<p>This is one we see all over the place, when calling functions or getting properties of objects, but often without really understanding it. It’s pretty simple, but we’ll first have to do a primer on data-types.</p>

<h3>1. Primitives and reference types</h3>

<p>In JavaScript there are a number of primitive types, and one (yes – one) reference type. Primitives include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>numbers</li>
  <li>strings</li>
  <li>boolean</li>
  <li>undefined</li>
  <li>null</li>
  <li>symbols</li>
</ul>

<p>All other values – arrays, objects, functions, RegExps etc., are reference types.</p>

<p>Amongst the reference types, one type is king: the object.</p>

<p>An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where the key is a symbol and the value can be anything.</p>

<p>When constructed using a literal, you use curly-braces, colons and commas:</p>

<code><pre>
let theKing = {
  firstName: ‘Elvis’,
  objectivelyBestSong: ‘Blue Moon’
}
</pre></code>

<p>The object is king among the reference types because all the other reference types are technically kinds of objects. For instance, an array is an object that uses numbers for its keys.</p>

<p>You can look up the properties of an object in two ways:</p>

<code><pre>
theKing.firstName // ‘Elvis’
theKing[‘objectivelyBestSong’] // ‘Blue Moon’
</pre></code>

<p>If you write one of your own objects, like our theKing object, you can use either syntax, where the latter takes strings, and so can be programmatically specified. However, for other objects, you cannot always use both forms. For instance, you cannot use the dot notation to look up an array item by index, because numbers are not valid <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/identifier">identifiers</a>.</p>

<code><pre>
[1, 2, 3][2]; // 3
</pre></code>

<h3>2. The dot operator always indicates object-property lookup</h3>

<p>Whenever you see the dot operator, it is being used to look up the properties of an object. Thus, when you see</p>

<code><pre>
[1, 2, 3, 4].length // 4
</pre></code>

<p>you are accessing the length property of the array.</p>

<p>This is exactly the same with function – or really, we should say <em>method</em> – calls:</p>

<code><pre>
3.toString() // ‘3’
[1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2) // [2, 4, 6]
</pre></code>

<h3>3. If objects are different to primitives and only objects have properties, how can we look up the properties of primitives?</h3>

<p>This is a good question. Above, we called the function toString() on a number. But a number is a primitive, not a reference type, so how could it have key-value pairs? Similarly, in the documentation (by which I mean MDN pages – if this article is at your level, I don't recommend reading <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/">the official ECMA spec</a>) we often find methods like</p>

<code><pre>
Number.toString()
</pre></code>

<p>‘Number’ is a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/understanding-javascript-constructors/">constructor function</a>. Functions are a kind of reference value. Whenever we see a function with this syntax in the documentation, we can call it on specific values that would be created by the constructor function, like 3 could be constructed by Number('3'). It is <em>through</em> the Number function that 3 gets access to the toString() function. If we take a look at the Number function by just typing Number into our browser dev tools and hitting enter, we can see that one of its properties is prototype: Number, one this property's properties is prototype: Object, and that one of <em>this</em> property's properties is function: toString(). So how is it that we can access the properties of the Number constructor function as properties of specific numbers, like 3, which are not supposed to have properties because numbers are primitives?</p>

<p>The answer is that JavaScript does some sleight of hand, to make things work, called <strong>autoboxing.</strong></p>

<p>Autoboxing is exactly what it sounds like, and its pretty simple: when you try to use a primitive like an object, the JavaScript engine temporarily wraps the primitive in an object and then accesses the properties of that object. After it's done, it marks the object as ready for garbage collection.</p>

<p>Because of autoboxing, when you try to reassign the value of a primitive that has a prototype, JavaScript does not throw an error but just seems to ignore you, while when you try to reassign the value of a primitive that does not have a prototype, JavaScript throws an error:</p>

<code><pre>
let str = “string”;
let na = null;
str[6] = “s”;
str; // “string”
str.lastIndex = str.length - 1;
str.lastIndex; // undefined
na.newProperty = “impossible”
// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'newProp' of null
  	at &lt;anonymous&gt;: 
</pre></code>

<p>The string, unlike null, is autoboxed. When you assign properties to it, you are assigning properties to its temporary wrapper object. However, because that wrapper object is temporary, those properties are not saved. null is not wrapped at all, so there is nothing to access with the dot operator and the JavaScript engine throws an error.</p> 

<p>So that’s it – the dot access operator is <em>always</em> looking at the property of an object – but what counts as an object sometimes shifts in order to accommodate convenient dot access.</p>
