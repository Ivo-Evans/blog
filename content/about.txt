    <h3>Why I'm writing this blog</h3>
    <p>My name is Ivo Evans, a learner, and now a teacher, based in London. I wanted to write this blog to give beginners information that I couldn't find easily, or that I struggled with, when I started learning to program. I'm certainly not an expert - hence the title, a pun on the fact that I have learnt important information, but only a 'bit' of it. In fact I am just about to start a bootcamp. I am still very much a learner, but I think that this actually makes me well-qualified as a teacher. There is <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/9853/chapter/5#44">some evidence</a> that people are effectively taught by those who are more knowledgeable than them, but not experts, because these teachers can remember the particular challenges facing the beginner without taking their knowledge for granted. Conversely, I think that being a teacher might make me a better-qualified <em>learner</em>: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/">pedagogy can be even more useful for the teacher than the student.</a> It's entirely possible that no one will ever read this blog, and that's fine. I have fun designing it and writing the posts.</p>
