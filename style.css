You should subtly blur out the bottom of the div, to obscure this problem*/

  /*
  On line-height:
  - setting line-height to 1em means that the text-expander moves by 1 line each time it moves.
  - However it has the downside that the bottom tip of long characters, like g's, extend into the line below - overflow for the last line, and highly compact for the other lines
  - The problem could possibly be solved by increasing line-height here, and using a multiplier in the js. I believe that default lineheight is 1.5 em, so we could increment and decrement by 1.5 instead of 1. However, I had some problems getting that working
  - There are some questions about how useful that is anyway, if we still need the line fade effect
  - but maybe if I did get that working, the line fade would no longer be necessary.
