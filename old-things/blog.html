        <p>Regex is a system of representing text.</p>
        <p>You could represent text many ways. The most obvious way is with one-to-one correspondence. This is what you do when you press ^F on your browser. You enter some text into the popup box, and the browser searches the page for text represented by whatever you entered into the box. One-to-one correspondence is useful, because it is extremely clear and exact. However, it is also limited by its exactness: if we want to match all email addresses but not other things containing @, or all lower-case a’s, or all upper-case A’s, or all a’s irrespective of case, one-to-one correspondence isn’t going to help us. We need regular expressions.</p>

We need regular expressions.</p>
        <p>If certain characters represent many possible character-matches, this begs an instant question: what if you truly only want to represent dots? In this case, you use an escape sequence. An escape sequence is any two-digit combination in which the first combination is a backslash (\). It ‘escapes’ the normal way that code is evaluated. Thus, \. represents dots themselves.</p>
        <p>These backslash escape sequences cut in two directions: firstly, as in \. , they can make a representation more exact. Secondly, they can make a representation less exact. For instance, in regex, s represents (you guessed it) s’s. However, \s represents whitespace: spaces and tabs (note that there is nothing stoppping you from simply using a space or a tab inside a regular expression). \s makes the s character less specific, while \. makes the . character more specific.</p>
        <p>So far so good: we’ve learnt about why regex exists, and using \ to make a character represent more or less possibilities. We’re almost there. The final thing we need to note is that in regex, discrete text-possibilities can be represented by character combinations, as well as escaped or unescaped single characters. There is no necessary relationship between the number of characters a regex represents, and the number of characters of the regex itself.</p>
        <p>For instance, [0-9] represents any character between 0 and 9 – ten characters. A regular expression containing 0-9 represents the text 0-9 literally. And one containing \[0-9\] represents the text [0-9] literally.</p>
        <p>To take another example, .{3,9} represents any substring which is at best 9 characters long and at least 3. Note the full stop – it represents ‘any character’. If we use a regex containing .{3, 9} to iteratively scan the string ‘123456789’, it will match 1-4 and 5-8, but not 9. Regex is greedy: it always takes as much as it can while preserving the integrity of its matches.</p>
        <p>There’s a lot more you can do with regex. You can give it a ‘global’ flag, so that it makes as many matches as it can, rather than just one match; you can feed it alternators, so that it alternates its search between two different expressions as it goes through the string from start to finish; you can indicate the start or end of a line; you can use lookaheads and lookbehinds, to capture substrings which are near to other substrings without capturing the nearby substrings themselves. Regex is extremely flexible, and that is what makes it so much more powerful than one-to-one representation.</p>
