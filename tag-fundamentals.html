    <p>TESTThis is one we see all over the place, when calling functions or getting properties of objects, but often without
  really understanding it. It’s pretty simple, but we’ll first have to do a primer on data-types.</p>
<h3>1. Primitives and reference types</h3>
<p>In JavaScript there are a number of primitive types, and one (yes – one) reference type. Primitives include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>numbers</li>
  <li>strings</li>
  <li>boolean</li>
  <li>undefined</li>
  <li>null</li>
  <li>symbols</li>
</ul>
<p>All other values – arrays, objects, functions, RegExps etc., are reference types.</p>
<p>Amongst the reference types, one type is king: the object.</p>
<p>An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where the key is a symbol and the value can be anything.</p>
<p>When constructed using a literal, you use curly-braces, colons and commas:</p>
<code><pre>
let theKing = {
  firstName: ‘Elvis’,
  objectivelyBestSong: ‘Blue Moon’
}
</pre></code>
<p>The object is king among the reference types because all the other reference types are technically kinds of objects.
  For instance, an array is an object that uses numbers for its keys.</p>
<p>You can look up the properties of an object in two ways:</p>
<code><pre>
theKing.firstName // ‘Elvis’
theKing[‘objectivelyBestSong’] // ‘Blue Moon’
</pre></code>
<p>If you write one of your own objects, like our theKing object, you can use either syntax, where the latter takes
  strings, and so can be programmatically specified. However, for other objects, you cannot always use both forms. For
  instance, you cannot use the dot notation to look up an array item by index, because numbers are not valid <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/identifier">identifiers</a>.</p>
<code><pre>
[1, 2, 3][2]; // 3
</pre></code>
<h3>2. The dot operator always indicates object-property lookup</h3>
<p>Whenever you see the dot operator, it is being used to look up the properties of an object. Thus, when you see</p>
<code><pre>
[1, 2, 3, 4].length // 4
</pre></code>
<p>you are accessing the length property of the array.</p>
<p>This is exactly the same with function – or really, we should say <em>method</em> – calls:</p>
<code><pre>
3.toString() // ‘3’
[1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2) // [2, 4, 6]
</pre></code>
<h3>3. If objects are different to primitives and only objects have properties, how can we look up the properties of
  primitives?</h3>
<p>This is a good question. Above, we called the function toString() on a number. But a number is a primitive, not a
  reference type, so how could it have key-value pairs? Similarly, in the documentation (by which I mean MDN pages – if
  this article is at your level, I don't recommend reading <a
    href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/">the official ECMA spec</a>) we often find methods like</p>
<code><pre>
Number.toString()
</pre></code>
<p>‘Number’ is a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/understanding-javascript-constructors/">constructor function</a>.
  Functions are a kind of reference value. Whenever we see a function with this syntax in the documentation, we can call
  it on specific values that would be created by the constructor function, like 3 could be constructed by Number('3').
  It is <em>through</em> the Number function that 3 gets access to the toString() function. If we take a look at the
  Number function by just typing Number into our browser dev tools and hitting enter, we can see that one of its
  properties is prototype: Number, one this property's properties is prototype: Object, and that one of <em>this</em>
  property's properties is function: toString(). So how is it that we can access the properties of the Number
  constructor function as properties of specific numbers, like 3, which are not supposed to have properties because
  numbers are primitives?</p>
<p>The answer is that JavaScript does some sleight of hand, to make things work, called <strong>autoboxing.</strong></p>
<p>Autoboxing is exactly what it sounds like, and its pretty simple: when you try to use a primitive like an object, the
  JavaScript engine temporarily wraps the primitive in an object and then accesses the properties of that object. After
  it's done, it marks the object as ready for garbage collection.</p>
<p>Because of autoboxing, when you try to reassign the value of a primitive that has a prototype, JavaScript does not
  throw an error but just seems to ignore you, while when you try to reassign the value of a primitive that does not
  have a prototype, JavaScript throws an error:</p>
<code><pre>
let str = “string”;
let na = null;
str[6] = “s”;
str; // “string”
str.lastIndex = str.length - 1;
str.lastIndex; // undefined
na.newProperty = “impossible”
// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'newProp' of null
  	at &lt;anonymous&gt;: 
</pre></code>
<p>The string, unlike null, is autoboxed. When you assign properties to it, you are assigning properties to its
  temporary wrapper object. However, because that wrapper object is temporary, those properties are not saved. null is
  not wrapped at all, so there is nothing to access with the dot operator and the JavaScript engine throws an error.</p>
<p>So that’s it – the dot access operator is <em>always</em> looking at the property of an object – but what counts as
  an object sometimes shifts in order to accommodate convenient dot access.</p>

    <p>Logic in programming does not map directly onto logic itself. This is fair enough. Logicians aren’t even sure, themselves, what logic is, while computers have to actually work. This means that logic in programming is something that one must learn about. When I first started programming, I lacked a clear and explicit guide and I found myself confused.</p>
<p>One thing that surprised me was that the logical connectors || and && could both return values other than true and false. Another thing that surprised me was the way that logic used what’s called short-circuit evaluation. A third thing that surprised me was that you could combine these two facts to make || and && statements into conditional, i.e. if-then, statements. But before we get into any of that, we should give a short description of || and &&.</p>
<h3>1. || and && 101</h3>
<p>|| is an ‘or’ operator and && is an ‘and’ operator. They each have an arity of two – they take two operands, one on each side, and return a value which represents the logical relationship between their two operands.</p>
<p>We typically represent these logical relationships with truth tables. Logic is taken to be bivalent: it only has two values, true or false – there is no third value, like ‘half true’ or ‘true in the right context’:</p>
<div class="parallel-code">
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>||</th>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>is...</th>
    <th>true</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>||</th>
    <th>false</th>
    <th>is...</th>
    <th>true</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>false</th>
    <th>||</th>
    <th>false</th>
    <th>is...</th>
    <th>false</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>false</th>
    <th>||</th>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>is...</th>
    <th>true</th>
  </tr>
</table>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>&&</th>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>is...</th>
    <th>true</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>&&</th>
    <th>false</th>
    <th>is...</th>
    <th>false</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>false</th>
    <th>&&</th>
    <th>false</th>
    <th>is...</th>
    <th>false</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>false</th>
    <th>&&</th>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>is...</th>
    <th>false</th>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Let’s imagine that we have three variables, isInLondon, isLearningToProgram and isAMasterPrgrommaer.</p>
<code><pre>
let isInLondon = true;
let isLearningToProgram = true;
let isAMasterProgrammer = false;
</pre></code>
<p>We can feed these variables to || and && for idiomatic assessments of logical relationships:</p>
<code><pre>
isInLondon && isLearningToProgram // true
isLearningToProgram || isAMasterProgrammer // true
isLearningToProgram && isAMasterProgrammer // false
</pre></code>
<p>Note that || is ‘nonexclusive’:</p>
<code><pre>
isInLondon || isLearningToProgram // true
</pre></code>
<p>For this reason, || and && are inverse operators – each of them returns one value in three cases, and the other in one case. We could also implement an exclusive or (XOR), if we wanted to, in which the above logical statement would come out false. However, the XOR is less important in programming and in logic in general. We'll skip over it for now.</p>
<h3>2. true v.s. truthy, false v.s. falsy</h3>
<p>When we’re programming, we give more values than true and false to the logical operators. How does this work?</p>
<p>It’s not quite like when you use logic in conversation. In conversation, like when you say ‘he is at home and eating dinner’, you feed the logical assertion two statements, sub in each statement for its truth-value at time of evaluation, and you see whether the whole expression is true. If it is, then the logical statement – an assertion of a logical relationship – is true and so should return a truth value.</p>
<p>In JavaScript it's a bit different. Look at this code:</p>
<code><pre>
"He's a master programmer" || "He's a whale" // "He's a master programmer"
"He's a whale" || "He's a master programmer" // "He's a whale"
"" || "He's a whale" // "He's a whale"
"He's a whale" || "" // "He's a whale"
</pre></code>
<p>Alas the computer, on balance, seems sure that I am a whale. But how does it <em>get</em> to that conclusion? It is not, I am afraid to say, to do with the important question of whether I am a master programmer or a whale.</p>
<p>This is because the computational notion of truth is somewhat divorced from the everyday one. For a computer, the question 'is it true?' is more like 'yes or no?' than 'is it an accurate representation of reality?' Computers were designed from the hardware up, and, at a basic level, they are collections of transistors which are either firing or not firing. Boolean logic, which was already a developed academic field, let the creators of modern computing use these two states - electricity or a lack of electricity - to represent information. True is represented, on a fundamental level, by a firing transistor, and false by a non-firing transistor. 1 and 0 can be used to the same effect as true and false - the symbol used does not matter, as long as the symbols are <em>binary</em> - that is, they let us represent two states.</p>
<p>JavaScript has moved on from using single transistors to represent truth values. In JavaScript, there are various kinds of value, and they can <em>all</em> be used in logical operations, even though they are not true or false <em>per se</em>. But what we can learn from the foundations of computing is that computational notions of true and false are not really about truth or falsity - the degree to which a representation is accurate - at all. The creators of programming languages have to make more or less arbitrary decisions about what values should behave like they're true, and what values should behave like they're false. The values which behave like they're true, whether or not they are the value true themselves, are called <em>truthy</em> values. The values that behave like they're false, whether or not they are the value false themselves, are called <em>falsy</em> values.</p>
  
<p>A truthy or falsy value can, at any time, do the job of true and false when used in logic, either as the input to or output from a logical operation, because they are temporarily coerced by the operator into Booleans.</p>
<p>So how can we tell what values are truthy, and what falsy? It's pretty easy. Almost every value is truthy, and there are only seven falsy values:</p>
<ul>
 <li>false</li>
 <li>0 and 0n</li>
 <li>empty strings</li>
 <li>undefined, null and NaN</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note, though, that there is some <a href="https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs#-is-truthy-but-not-true">funny business</a> about empty arrays and null.)</p>

<p>Now we can see how the computer realised that I'm a whale dressed as a human, and that I'm not a master programmer: In the first line of code above, || receives two truthy strings, and outputs a truthy string; in the third line of code above, || receives a truthy and falsy string, and outputs a truthy string. It's okay to output strings, rather than true or false, because the output of the operation is just as truthy/falsy as the input. Consulting our truth tables from earlier, then, we can see that the operations have logically valid output.</p>
<h3>3. Short-circuit evaluation</h3>
<p>So, || and && don’t return truth values, but rather their left-hand-side (LHS) or right-hand-side (RHS) - two terms that will be cropping up a lot from here on. How do || and && decide which side to return, when they could return either of two?</p> 
<p>Programming languages, by convention, check first the LHS and then the RHS. Sometimes, after the first result, the conclusion is determined. For instance, in the statement:</p>
<code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
<p>if LHS is falsy, then, no matter what RHS is, the and-statement, as a whole, must be false. The computer can save time by just ceasing it’s evaluation after it finds LHS to be false. If it finds LHS to be true, it needs to proceed to RHS; if RHS is true, the and-statement is true, and if it is false then, even though LHS is true, the and-statement is false. Either way, though, if LHS is true the truth of the and-statement rests entirely on RHS.</p>
<p>The converse holds for || statements:</p>
<code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
<p>If LHS is true, then, by fiat, the or-statement is true. However, if LHS is false, we still need to check RHS. If it is true, the statement passes, but if it is false, the statement fails.</p>
<p>Since || and && statements do not return truth values, but either the LHS or RHS, in</p>
<code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
<p>if LHS is false, we can return that; else, if LHS is true, we will return RHS. We don't even need to check whether RHS is truty or falsy; whatever it is, it will be logically valid. In</p>
<code><pre>
LHS || RHS
</pre></code>
<p>if LHS is true, we can return that; else, if LHS is false, we will return RHS.</p>
<p>This is short-circuit evaluation. It is a simple, elegant and – dare I say it –  a logical solution. There is no need to compute  a third value (true or false) which represents the operator’s decision. It is guaranteed that we can repurpose one of the inputs, and that we will repurpose the leftmost appropriate input.</p>
<p>Now, before we close off this section, we should think a little about the consequences of returning truthy and falsy values instead of true and false. Because we can rely on the explicit rules of short-circuit evaluation, we can use logic to do things like decide on our variable assignments for us:</p>
<code><pre>
let a = 1
let b = “”
let c = a && b
c // “”
</pre></code>
<h3>4. || and && and conditional logic</h3>
<p>So far, we’ve covered the meaning of short-circuit evaluation and truthiness and falsiness for || and &&. But these are not the only logical operations we do when programming. One other thing we do is express conditional logic, logic which expresses if-then relationships. Such conditional logic, sometimes called flow-control, lets us establish branching possibilities within our programs.</p>
<p>The most common kind of conditional statements are if statements, if-else statements, and if-else if -else statements (two if-else statements stuck together). First let’s look at an if statement:</p>
<code><pre>
let a = 5;
if (a) {
  console.log(‘a is true’);
}
</pre></code>
<p>Notice that in this statement, we do not need to say if (a == true). a’s truthiness is enough for the logic to execute.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do want to use operators on values to generate new boolean values, as in this if-else if-else statement, where the < operator is used:</p>
<code><pre>
if (a < 10) {
  console.log(‘less than ten’);
} else if (a < 50) {
  console.log(‘less than fifty’);
} else {
  console.log(‘wow a must be really big”);
}
</pre></code>
<p>The output of this code is ‘less than ten’, even though, of course, a is less than fifty. What we see here is a chain of logic that has the same effect as short-circuit evaluation. The second condition, if (a < 50), is itself dependent on the falsity of the first condition, because it is attached to the first condition’s else statement. The second condition is effectively</p>
<code><pre>
if (!(a < 10)) && (a < 50)
</pre></code>
<p>Because of this, after the program satisfies that first condition, (a < 10), it simply stops looking at the other conditions, which are premised on the falsity of earlier conditions. To print both conditions, we could attach them to separate if statements, rather than premising later if statements on the else statements of earlier if statements.</p>
<p>So we can see that conditional logic effectively short-circuits, and we saw earlier that || and && statements short-circuit too. This similarity cuts deep: it lets us use || and && to make conditional statements, and conditional statements to make || and && statements.</p>
<p>Here are || and && implemented as functions that use conditional logic:</p>
<code><pre>
  function or(leftHandSide, rightHandSide) {
    if (leftHandSide) {
      return leftHandSide;
    } else {
      return rightHandSide; 
    }
  }
</pre></code>
<code><pre>
  function and(leftHandSide, rightHandSide) {
    if (leftHandSide) {
      return rightHandSide;
      } else {
      return leftHandSide;
      }
  }      
</pre></code>      
<p>There’s a nice kind of symmetry here: the only difference between the two functions is what the truthiness of the LHS indicates. In the or function, it indicates that evaluation can stop. In the and function it indicates that evaluation must continue.</p>
<p>We can implement a converse kind of functionality with || and && operators.</p>
<code><pre>
  function ifThen(antecedent, consequent) {
    return antecedent && consequent;
  }
</pre></code>
<code><pre>
  function ifNotThen(antecedent, consequent) {
    return antecedent || consequent;
  }  
</pre></code>      
<p>I’ve introduced two new terms here, ‘antecedent’ and ‘consequent’. These just mean ‘the bit that comes before’ and ‘the bit that comes after’ in a conditional statement. In the statement ‘if I go to Alaska, I will fulfill a lifelong ambition’, ‘I go to Alaska’ is the antecedent, and ‘I will fulfill a lifelong ambition’ is the consequent.</p>
<p>The two functions above are not that practical. But using the logical operators && and || to express conditions can be practical. Let’s take a realistic example, trying to parse a string and return an array that contains any numbers inside the string. Given the string:</p>
<code><pre>
	‘1 2 ,4 &:\ 301’
</pre></code>
<p>we should return</p>
  
<code><pre>
	[‘1’, ‘2’, ‘4’, ‘301’]
</pre></code>
<p>To achieve this, we will use the match() function and feed match() a regex.  Our regex will look like this:</p>
<code><pre>
	/[0-9]+/g
</pre></code>
<p>[0-9] represents any character 0..9. The plus symbol means ‘one or more of what I preceded’ - [0-9]. The g is a flag which means global, and tells match() to return more than one match.</p>
<p>We’re all set up, and writing this function should be simple enough.</p>
<p>However, there is a hitch. A requirement of our function is that it returns an array, even if the array is empty. But match() has an idiosyncrasy: if it finds no matches, it doesn’t return an empty array or an empty string, but returns null.</p>
<p>How are we to solve the problem? Recall that null is falsy. We can use this to our advantage with some conditional logic.</p>
<code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  let result = string.match(/[0-9]+/g);
  if (result) {
   return result;
  } else {
    return [];
}
</pre></code>
<p>This is all right, but it’s quite long. We can shorten the same logic with the ternary operator, a quick way to write if-else statements:</p>
<code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  let result = string.match(/[0-9]+/g);
  return result ? result : [];
  // if result is truthy, return result, else, return []
}
</pre></code>
<p>This is good. However, we can do even better with the || operator:</p>
<code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  return string.match(/[0-9]+/g) || [];
}
</pre></code>
<p>And this is where using || for conditional logic really shines.</p>
<p>Of course, you should not always use || and &&. If you want to use multiple consequents, you should opt for the full-fledged if(){} else{} structure. And even for more compact if-else conditions, rather than if-then or if-not-then, the ternary operator is generally preferable.</p>
<p>However, if what you want to say is ‘if a then b, else a’, or ‘if not a then b, else a’ - in other words, if you want to choose between two operands - consider using a && b or a || b. And remember, logic in programming doesn't really bear much of a relation to logic, or to truth and falsity - it's just an arbitrary set of rules for the transformation of data. </p>

    <p>It doesn't need to be an awkward discussion. All we need is some simple <strong>vocabulary</strong></p>
<h3>1. Arity</h3>
<p>An operator’s arity is the number of arguments – also called operands – that it takes. For instance, comparison operators have an arity of two – they take two operands:</p>
<pre><code>
	// true
	5 < 10
</code></pre>
<p>Here, 5 is one operand and 10 is another.</p>
<p>An arity of two is the most common arity in JavaScript. Some operators have an arity of 1:</p>
<pre><code>
	!false
	// true
	typeof true
	// boolean
</code></pre>
<p>One operator has an arity of three, the ternary operator. Ternary means 'composed of three parts' and the ternary operator is used to express conditional logic:</p>
<pre><code>
	condition ? true : false
</code></pre>
<p>The first operand, the bit to the left of the ?, is a condition to be evaluated. If it is evaluated to true, then the second operand, the bit in between ? and :, is executed. If the first operand is evaluated to false,  the third operand, the bit after :, is executed.</p>
<pre><code>
	let iAmIvo = true;
	function amIIvo(bool) {
	  return bool ? ‘yup’ : ‘no’;
	}
	amIIvo(iAmIvo); // ‘yup’
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Associativity</h3>
<p>Next up is an operator’s associativity. This isn’t about how operators interact with each other (that’s precedence) but about how operands interact with each other and with the operator. Basically it is the direction in which operands are evaluated. It can be either right-to-left or left-to-right. When an operator is left-to-right associative, we sometimes say that it is left-associative, and when it is right-to-left associative, we sometimes say that it is right associative.</p>
<p>Mathematical and logical operators are left-to-right associative:</p>
<pre><code>
	10 – 5 // 5
	true || false // true
</code></pre>
<p>The ternary operator is left-associative too:</p>
<pre><code>
	condition ? ‘true’ : ‘false’
</code></pre>
<p>Assignment, on the other hand, is right-to-left associative:</p>
<pre><code>
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;
	let c = a;
	c; // 1 
</code></pre>
<p>Unary operators - operators with an arity of 1 - tend to be right-associative:</p>
<pre><code>
	!false
	// true	
	typeof Object
	// “function”
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Precedence</h3>
<p>A function’s precedence expresses where it stands in relation to other operators. If it has a high precedence, it is evaluated early. This means that it has first dibs on its operands. If it has low precedence, it is evaluated later. It receives only the operands that other operators didn’t want, or have already processed.</p>
<p>Look at this mathematical expression:</p>
<pre><code>
	1 * (0 – 1) === 1 * 0 – 1
	// true
</code></pre>
<p>Since it returns true, we can tell that the logical comparison operator === has lower precedence than the numerical operators. If it had high precedence – first dibs – it would compare (0 – 1) with (1), and find them nonequal. However, in actuality it compares -1 with -1 and finds them equal.</p>
<h3>4. Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Putting it all together, we can now explain exactly why compound expressions work like they do. Let's take an example:</p>
<pre><code>
a > b && a > c || !(a || c) ? 'something' : 'something else';
</code></pre>
<p>There's some relatively thorny logic here that could do with some unpicking. We can use the terms we just learned to uncover the secrets of the expression. As we go along, I'll tell you the relative values of operators, but there's also a link to a comparison table at the end of this article.</p>
<p>The operator with the highest precedence here is the grouping operator, aka the parentheses (), so we evaluate these first. Inside we find a || c, so we evaluate that.</p>
<p>The operator with the next highest precedence is the logical not operator !, so we flip whatever we got from the parentheses</p>
<p>This is actually an application of De Morgan's law, which states, basically, that</p>
<code><pre>
!(a || b) == !a && !b;
!(a && b) == !a || !b;
</pre></code>
<p>The operator with the next highest precedence is the greater-than operator >. There are two of those, so we evaluate first the left-hand one and then the right-hand one. Each of them will return a truth value.</p>
<p>The next highest precedence is &&; the last operation returned two truth values on either side of it, so we feed those to && to receive a boolean.</p>
<p>next we have ||, which is lower than &&. After evakuating that, we are finally ready to evaluate the ternary operator ? :, which is the operator with the lowest precedence in this operation, and return a result.</p>
<p>I hope you can see, from this example, that the properties of arity, associativity and precedence neatly divide the conceptual space for operator interaction. With them, as well as an understanding of the valid inputs to and outputs from an operator, you can learn precisely about the relationships between operators. As a next step, you might want to consult a comparative table like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table">this one</a>.</p>

      Regex 2: How regular expressions fit into JavaScript

    <p>Regular expressions, as a system for representing text, are found in most programming languages. In this post, I’m going to focus on JavaScript, which happens to be my favourite programming language (although, it must be said, not for its implementation of regex).</p>
<h3>1: regular expressions are values</h3>
<p>In JavaScript regular expressions are a data-type called RegExp. Like most data-types, they can be constructed using literals or an object constructor:</p>
<pre><code>
‘5’ // a string literal
String(5) // a string created by the constructor function for the string type
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax for a RegExp literal is to enclose the expression within two forward slashes:</p>
<code>/(ab){3}/   // a regex matching 3 consecutive ab’s: ababab</code>
<p>This forward-slash syntax was popularised by Perl, a language which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#History">did a lot for regular expressions<a>. It is also the most common way to make regular expressions in JavaScript. Since RegExps are not strings, there is no need for any string syntax when creating a RegExp literal. This is different when using the RegExp constructor. Here, we drop the forward slashes, and feed the constructor a string as its argument, leaving it up to the function to make the regular expression for us:</p>
<code>RegExp(‘(ab){3}’)</code>
<p>Because regular expressions are objects, they can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Given to functions as arguments</li>
    <code>"123”.match(/2/) // ["2", index: 1, input: "123", groups: undefined]</code>
  <li>Returned from functions</li>
    <code>RegExp(‘a’) // returns a regular expression</code>
  <li>functions can be called on them</li>
    <code>/a/.test(‘a hungry hippo’) // true</code>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look in more detail at two functions that work with regular expressions, match() and replace(). Both of these functions are called on strings and take regular expressions as arguments.</p>
<h3>2: match()</h3>
<p>match() returns matches it finds. By default, match() returns an object corresponding to the first match it found.</p>
<pre><code>
let str = “stringy string”
str.match(/[ng]/) // ["n", index: 4, input: "stringy string", groups: undefined]
// square brackets [] mean ‘any of these characters’.
str // “stringy string”
</code></pre>
<p>However, match really comes into its own when you give the regex the global flag. Then, match returns an array of substrings that match the regex. You give flags to regex literals by adding a letter after the second forward slash, and to regex constructor functions by providing a second argument:</p>
<pre><code>
let regExOne = /st/g
let regExTwo = RegExp(‘[ng]’, ‘g’)
str.match(regExOne); // [“st”, “st”]
str.match(regExTwo); // [“n”, “g”, “n”, “g”]
</code></pre>
<h3>3: replace()</h3>
<p>Next up is replace(), which replaces a substring with another, or multiple substrings with another if you use the global flag. replace() takes two arguments. First, it searches the string on which it was called according to its first argument, a regex. Secondly, it substitutes a match, if it finds one, using its second argument. It does not ‘mutate’ the string it is called on – strings are immutable in JavaScript – but returns a new string.</p>
<p>When I add articles to this blog, I write them to text files, and then I run a program that I wrote and it compiles HTML for me, ensuring that articles appear in the right place, get added to the archive page automatically, and things like that. I used Ruby to write this program but it could have been done in JavaScript too. It scans a text file called website-template.html, finds a line which says
<p><code>&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;</code>,</p>
<p><em>replaces</em> that line with article content that it got elsewhere, and then writes the new string to a new file - a file just like the one your browser has rendered to let you read this. (Here's the relevant <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/blog/blob/master/resources/modules/writable.rb">Ruby method</a> if you're curious.)</p>
<p>I could have used string-for-string replacement, like</p>
<code>webSite = webSite.replace('&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;', mainContent);</code>
<p>However, I opted for a regular expression:</p>
<code>webSite = webSite.replace(/^\s*&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;/, mainContent);</code>
</p>This regular expression matches 0 or more whitespace characters from the beginning of the line to the end of &lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt.</p> 
<p>I used regex for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If I used regex, I could allow for a varying amount of whitespace.</li>
  <li>The input was expectable and controllable, so this was a very safe regular expression.</li>
  <li>The Ruby method I used was going to read my string as a regular expression anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these reasons tells us something wider about why and when to use regular expressions.</p>
<p> A good reason to use them, as discussed in the last article, is that they allow more general matching than one-to-one correspondence. In this case generality solved a specific problem for me: while I knew what I wanted matching lines to say, I didn't want to commit to indenting them some specific amount, because I might change the html template. I also didn't want to only select the comment itself, and not whitespace preceding it on the line, because then when I wrote the new content the first line would have more indentation than other lines. A regex which allowed me to select from the beginning of the line, to a specific match, including an arbitrary amount of whitespace, proved useful.</p>
<p>It was also a good case for a regex because it was very easy to control. If you want to use regular expressions to sift large and unpredictable data-sets, you will have to think carefully. For instance, it is generally not recommended to use regular expressions to write parsers for programming languages. For less-lofty aims, regular expressions can be useful, but you do need to be careful with them. If you cast your net too wide, you might catch some junk. Once you get beyond syntax, for regex, the crux of the challenge is often striking the right balance between specificity and generality.</p>
<p>Finally, a good reason to use regular expressions is their prevalence. Regular expressions are <em>everywhere</em>, and so you can count on them as a useful and transferable skill for efficient and sophisticated - but not too sophisticated - text-matching.</p>
<h3>4: conclusion</h3>
<p>This marks the end of my brief series on regex. I hope I've equipped you with an appreciation of the usefulness of regular expressions, as well as a grasp of the fundamentals.</p>

    <p>Regex, also called regular expressions and regexp, is a system of representing text.</p>
<p>You could represent text many ways. The most obvious way is with one-to-one correspondence. This is what you do when you press ^F on your browser. You enter some text into the popup box, and the browser searches the page for text represented by whatever you entered. One-to-one correspondence is useful, because it is both clear and exact. However, it is also limited by its exactness: if we want to match all email addresses but not other things containing @, one-to-one correspondence isn’t going to help us. We need regular expressions.
<p>Regular expressions trade off exact, one-to-one representation, and therefore clarity, for generality. In regex, certain characters and combinations of characters do not only represent one possibility but many possibilities. For instance, a dot (.) represents ‘any character’.</p>
<p>If certain characters represent many possible characters, this begets an instant question: what if you want to represent a specific character, not the more-general set of characters that it normally represents? What if you really only want to match dots? In this case, you use an escape sequence. An escape sequence is any two-digit combination in which the first combination is a backslash (\). It ‘escapes’ the normal way that code is evaluated. Thus, \. represents dots themselves. \ is an escaped backslash – it matches a single \</p>
<p>These backslash escape sequences cut in two directions: firstly, as in \. , they can make a representation more exact. Secondly, they can make a representation less exact. In regex, s represents (you guessed it) s’s. However, \s represents whitespace: spaces and tabs (note that there is nothing stoppping you from simply using a space or a tab inside a regular expression). \s makes the s character less specific, while \. makes the . character more specific.</p>
<p>So far so good: we’ve learnt about why regex exists, and using \ to make a character represent more or less possibilities. We’re almost there. The final thing we need to note is that in regex, there is no necessary relationship between the number of characters a regex represents, and the number of characters of the regex itself. For instance, a regular expression can include what are called 'zero-length assertions', like ^ or $. The caret (^) represents the beginning of a line, and the dollar-sign ($) the end of a line. Neither the beginning nor the end of the line are parts of the string <em>per se</em> because the string is simply a collection of characters. Zero-length assertions take up space in your regular expressions, but do not represent space but, rather, position.</p>
<p>Zero-length assertions demonstrate that regular expressions can match less text than they take up. On the other hand, there are assertions that match more characters than their weight in regex. For instance, [0-9] represents any one character between 0 and 9 – ten characters. The text</p>
	<pre>numbers0123456789</pre>
<p>could be matched by [0-9] in exactly ten places, corresponding to the digits in-range. (A regular expression containing 0-9, on the other hand, represents the text 0-9 literally, and one containing \[0-9\] represents the text [0-9] literally.)</p>
<p>To take another example, .{2,4} represents any substring which is at best 4 characters long and at least 2. Note the full stop – it represents ‘any character’. If we use a regex containing .{2, 4} to iteratively scan the string ‘123456789’, it will match 1-4 and 5-8, but not 9. Regex is ‘greedy’: it always takes as much as it can while preserving the integrity of its matches.</p>
</p>Putting this all together, we can do some powerful matching, like matching all but the first word on a line, without knowing the line. We can match 'evening' in</p>
<pre>"morning evening"</pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre> .+$</pre> 
<p> where + represents 'one or more of the preceding character' and . represents 'any character'. You can't see it, but there is a space before the . too. So our regex means 'The largest possible substring composed of one space, and then one or more of any character, until the end of the line'.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more you can do with regex. You can give it a ‘global’ flag, so that it makes as many matches as it can, rather than just one match; you can feed it alternators, so that it alternates its search between two different expressions as it goes through the string from start to finish; you can use lookaheads and lookbehinds, to capture substrings which are near to other substrings without capturing the nearby substrings themselves. Regex is extremely flexible, and that is what makes it so much more powerful than one-to-one representation.</p>
<p>Some people love to hate regex, but actually, given the choice, I don't think I would trade it in for anything different. It’s generality - so often complained about - is the very source of its power.</p>
