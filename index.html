        <p>It doesn't need to be an awkward discussion. All we need is some simple <strong>vocabulary</strong></p>
        <h3>1. Arity</h3>
        <p>An operator’s arity is the number of arguments – also called operands – that it takes. For instance, comparison operators have an arity of two – they take two operands:</p>
        <pre><code>
	// true
	5 < 10
</code></pre>
        <p>here, 5 is one operand and 10 is another.</p>
        <p>An arity of two is the most common arity in JavaScript. Some operators have an arity of 1:</p>
        <pre><code>
	!false
	// true
	typeof true
	// boolean
</code></pre>
        <p>One operator has an arity of three, the ternary operator. Ternary means 'composed of three parts' and the ternary operator is used to express conditional logic:</p>
        <pre><code>
	condition ? true : false
</code></pre>
        <p>The first operand, the bit to the left of the ?, is a condition to be evaluated. If it is evaluated to true, then the second operand, the bit in between ? and :, is executed. If the first operand is evaluated to false,  the third operand, the bit after :, is executed.</p>
        <pre><code>
	let iAmIvo = true;
	function amIIvo(bool) {
	  return bool ? ‘yup’ : ‘no’;
	}
	amIIvo(iAmIvo); // ‘yup’
</code></pre>
        <h3>2. Associativity</h3>
        <p>Next up is an operator’s associativity. This isn’t about how operators interact with each other (that’s precedence) but about how operands interact with each other and with the operator. Basically it is the direction in which operands are evaluated. It can be either right-to-left or left-to-right. When an operator is left-to-right associative, we sometimes say that it is left-associative, and when it is right-to-left associative, we sometimes say that it is right associative.</p>
        <p>Mathematical and logical operators are left-to-right associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	10 – 5 // 5
	true || false // true
</code></pre>
        <p>The ternary operator is left-associative too:</p>
        <pre><code>
	condition ? ‘true’ : ‘false’
</code></pre>
        <p>Assignment, on the other hand, is right-to-left associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;
	let c = a;
	c; // 1 
</code></pre>
        <p>Unary operators - operators with an arity of 1 - tend to be right-associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	!false
	// true	
	typeof Object
	// “function”
</code></pre>
        <h3>3. Precedence</h3>
        <p>A function’s precedence expresses where it stands in relation to other operators. If it has a high precedence, it is evaluated early. This means that it has first dibs on its operands. If it has low precedence, it is evaluated later. It receives only the operands that other operators didn’t want, or have, already processed.</p>
        <p>Look at this mathematical expression:</p>
        <pre><code>
	1 * (0 – 1) === 1 * 0 – 1
	// true
</code></pre>
        <p>Since it returns true, we can tell that the logical comparison operator === has lower precedence than the numerical operators. If it had high precedence – first dibs – it would compare (0 – 1) with (1), and find them nonequal. However, in actuality it compares -1 with -1 and finds them equal.</p>
        <h3>4. Putting it all together</h3>
        <p>Putting it all together, we can now explain exactly why compound expressions work like they do. Let's take an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
	2 * (4 – 1) !== 2 * 4 – 1 ? "they’re not equal" : "they’re equal"
</code></pre>
        <p>The operator with the highest precedence here is the grouping operator (), followed by *, so we should start with the sums,</p>
        <pre><code>
	2 * (4 – 1)
	2 * 4 – 1
</code></pre>
        <p>which resolve to 6 and 7 respectively. The brackets introduce a difference, not because the multiplication operator is further to the left than the subtraction operator, but because multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction (following <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html">PEMDAS/BIDMAS</a>). The mathematical operators each take two operands, and are left-to-right associative. So we take 1 away from 4 and then multiply by 2, leaving 6</p>
        <p>the operator with the next highest precedence is the inequality operator. It has an arity of two, but it doesn't really matter whether it is right-associative or left-associative, because it tests for equality. It receives two numbers - 6 and 7 - and finds them to be unequal. Therefore it returns true.</p>
        <p>Finally we have the ternary operator, the lowest-precedence operator in the equation above. It is left-associative, so it looks first to its left-hand-side, and uses that information to decide between its remaining operands. Since its left-hand-side is the value true, it chooses its second operand, "they are not equal".</p>
        <p>These three properties, arity, associativity and precedence, neatly divide the conceptual space for operators. With them, you can say all that you need to say, and learn precisely about the relationships between operators. As a good next step, you might want to consult a comparative table like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table">this one</a>.</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I came up with this solution when trying to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 10 but having troulbe adjusting boot order. After phoning HP and finding that access to my boot order had been deliberately obfuscated to make sure people boot into the 'right' operating system, Windows 10 - thanks HP - I turned my efforts to accessing the BIOS, from which I could get to Ubuntu's bootloader relatively quickly. I wrote a Powershell function which, when executed, restarts the computer directly into the firmware settings. No more button-bashing, and a lot of time saved.</p>
        <p>To follow along you don't need any real PowerShell knowledge. Our strategy will be to define a function in your user PowerShell profile ($PROFILE), a text file which is read every time you open PowerShell. That way, the function will always be defined, and all you need to do is call it.</p> 
        <h3>1. Prepare your $PROFILE</h3>
        <p>This text file does not exist by default, but you might already have it. To see whether you do, enter</p>
        <code>test-path $PROFILE</code>
        <p>Note that PowerShell, unlike Linux shells, is case-insensitive, so you can just as well write</p>
        <code>test-path $profile</code>
        <p>This cmmdlet works because there is already a path to the profile written into your system - you just might not yet have the profile itself. If it returns false, enter</p>
        <code>New-Item -path $profile -type file</code>
        <p>Now everyone should have a profile file, we can open and edit it with</p>
        <pre><code>
notepad $PROFILE
code $PROFILE # for vscode
atom $PROFILE 
etc.
</code></pre>
        <h3>2. Add a function to your $profile</h3>
        <p>The function we are going to write can be anywhere inside your profile (except within other code). What it does is run two cmmdlets successively. The first one opens a PowerShell instance that has administrator privileges. The second one uses our administrator privileges to reboot you into firmware.</p>
        <p>The first looks like this:</p>
        <code>Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs</code>
        <p>To run it, you might have to press yes on a dialogue box that opens up. The quickest way to do that is to press left arrow then enter.</p>
        <p>The second cmmdlet looks like this:</p>
        <code>shutdown /fw /r /t 0</code>
        <p>/fw means 'firmware', /r 'restart', and /t 0 'after 0 seconds'.</p>
        <p>Our final function looks like this</p>
        <pre><code>
	function boot-fw {
	  Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs -ArgumentList 'shutdown /fw /r /t 0'
	}
</code></pre>
        <p>We feed the second cmmdlet to the first one as a string following -ArgumentList. We then wrap that whole thing in a function, called boot-fw. Best practice is to use verb-noun format to avoid namespace conflicts - but on my own system I broke the rules and went for an even shorter name, fboot. Just put this function anywhere in your $profile and, after opening a new powershell instance, it should be available.</p>
        <p>Now you can type boot-fw to boot into your firmware settings. Or to boot for the win, whatever you like.</p> 
        <p>PROTIP: adding the line Clear-Host to your $PROFILE means that when you open a new PowerShell window you won't see any of Windows' proprietary junk. You might want to check out other things that you can add to the profile, like some (limited) theming.</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Regular expressions, as a system for representing text, are found in most programming languages. In this post, I’m going to focus on JavaScript, which happens to be my favourite programming language (although not for its implementation of regex, which currently lacks some features, like lookbehinds and interpolation).</p>
        <h3>1: regular expressions are values</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript regular expressions are a data-type called RegExp. Like most data-types, they can be constructed using literals or an object constructor:</p>
        <pre><code>
‘5’ // a string literal
String(5) // a string created by the constructor function for the string type
</code></pre>
        <p>The syntax for a RegExp literal is to enclose the expression within two forward slashes:</p>
        <code>/(ab){3}/   // a regex matching 3 consecutive ab’s: ababab</code>
        <p>This forward-slash syntax was popularised by Perl, a language which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#History">did a lot for regular expressions<a>. It is also the most common syntax in JavaScript. Since RegExps are not strings, there is no need for any string syntax when creating a RegExp literal. This is different when using the RegExp constructor. Here, we drop the forward slashes, and feed the constructor a string as its argument, leaving it up to the function to make the regular expression for us:</p>
        <code>RegExp(‘(ab){3}’)</code>
        <p>Because regular expressions are objects, they can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Given to functions as arguments</li>
            <code>123”.match(/2/) // ["2", index: 1, input: "123", groups: undefined]</code>
          <li>Returned from functions</li>
            <code>RegExp(‘a’) // returns a regular expression</code>
          <li>functions can be called on them</li>
            <code>/a/.test(‘a hungry hippo’) // true</code>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s look in more detail at two functions that work with regular expressions, match() and replace(). Both of these functions are called on strings and take regular expressions as arguments.</p>
        <h3>2: match()</h3>
        <p>match() returns matches it finds. By default, match() returns an object corresponding to the first match it found.</p>
        <pre><code>
let str = “stringy string”
str.match(/[ng]/) // ["n", index: 4, input: "stringy string", groups: undefined]
// square brackets [] mean ‘any of these characters’.
str // “stringy string”
</code></pre>
        <p>However, match really comes into its own when you give the regex the global flag. Then, match returns an array of substrings that match the regex. You give flags to regex literals by adding a letter after the second forward slash, and to regex constructor functions by providing a second argument:</p>
        <pre><code>
let regExOne = /st/g
let regExTwo = RegExp(‘[ng]’, ‘g’)
str.match(regExOne); // [“st”, “st”]
str.match(regExTwo); // [“n”, “g”, “n”, “g”]
</code></pre>
        <h3>3: replace()</h3>
        <p>Next up is replace(), which replaces a substring with another, or multiple substrings with another if you use the global flag. replace() takes two arguments. First, it searches the string on which it was called according to its first argument, a regex. Secondly, it substitutes a match, if it finds one, using its second argument. It does not ‘mutate’ the string it is called on – strings are immutable in JavaScript – but returns a new string.</p>
        <p>When I add articles to this blog, I write them to text files, and then I run a program that I wrote and it compiles HTML for me, ensuring that articles appear in the right place, get added to the archive page automatically, and things like that. I used Ruby to write this program but it could have been done in JavaScript too. It scans a text file called website-template.html, finds a line which says
        <p><code>&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;</code>,</p>
        <p><em>replaces</em> that line with article content that it got elsewhere, and then writes the new string to a new file - a file just like the one your browser has rendered to let you read this. Here's the relevant <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/blog/blob/master/resources/modules/writable.rb">Ruby method</a>, if you're curious.</p>
        <p>I could have used string-for-string replacement, like</p>
        <code>webSite = webSite.replace('&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;', mainContent);</code>
        <p>However, I opted for a regular expression:</p>
        <code>webSite = webSite.replace(/^\s*&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;/, mainContent);</code>
        </p>This regular expression matches 0 or more whitespace characters from the beginning of the line to the end of &lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt.</p> 
        <p>I used regex for three reasons:</p>
        <ol>
  <li>If I used regex, I could allow for a varying amount of whitespace.</li>
  <li>The input was expectable and controllable, so this was a very <em>safe</em> regular expression.</li>
  <li>The Ruby method I used was going to read my string as a regular expression <em>anyway</em>.</li>
</ol>
        <p>Each of these reasons tells us something wider about why and when to use regular expressions.</p>
        <p> A good reason to use them, as discussed in the last article, is that they allow more general matching than one-to-one correspondence. In this case this generality solved a specific problem for me: while I knew what I wanted matching lines to say, I didn't want to commit to indenting them some specific amount, because I might change the html template. I also didn't want to only select the comment itself, and not whitespace preceding it on the line, because then when I wrote the new content the first line would have more indentation than other lines. A regex which allowed me to select from the beginning of the line, to a specific match, including an arbitrary amount of whitespace, proved useful.</p>
        <p>It was also a good case for a regex because it was very easy to control. If you want to use regular expressions to sift large and unpredictable data-sets, you will have to think carefully. For instance, it is generally not recommended to use regular expressions to write parsers for programming languages. For less-lofty aims, regular expressions can be useful, but you do need to be careful with them. If you cast your net too wide, you will probably catch a lot of junk. Once you get beyond syntax, for regex, the crux of the challenge is often striking the right balance between specificity and generality.</p>
        <p>Finally, a good reason to use regular expressions is their prevalence. Regular expressions are <em>everywhere</em>, and so you can count on them as a useful and transferable skill for efficient and sophisticated - but not too sophisticated - text-matching.</p>
        <h3>4: conclusion</h3>
        <p>This marks the end of my brief series on regex. I hope I've equipped you with an appreciation of the usefulness of regular expressions, as well as a grasp of the fundamentals.</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Regex, also called regular expressions and regexp, is a system of representing text.</p>
        <p>You could represent text many ways. The most obvious way is with one-to-one correspondence. This is what you do when you press ^F on your browser. You enter some text into the popup box, and the browser searches the page for text represented by whatever you entered. One-to-one correspondence is useful, because it is both clear and exact. However, it is also limited by its exactness: if we want to match all email addresses but not other things containing @, one-to-one correspondence isn’t going to help us. We need regular expressions.
        <p>Regular expressions trade off exact, one-to-one representation, and therefore clarity, for generality. In regex, certain characters and combinations of characters do not only represent one possibility but many possibilities. For instance, a dot (.) represents ‘any character’.</p>
        <p>If certain characters represent many possible characters, this begets an instant question: what if you want to represent a specific character, not the more-general set of characters that it normally represents? What if you really only want to match dots? In this case, you use an escape sequence. An escape sequence is any two-digit combination in which the first combination is a backslash (\). It ‘escapes’ the normal way that code is evaluated. Thus, \. represents dots themselves. \\ is an escaped backslash – it matches a single \</p>
        <p>These backslash escape sequences cut in two directions: firstly, as in \. , they can make a representation more exact. Secondly, they can make a representation less exact. In regex, s represents (you guessed it) s’s. However, \s represents whitespace: spaces and tabs (note that there is nothing stoppping you from simply using a space or a tab inside a regular expression). \s makes the s character less specific, while \. makes the . character more specific.</p>
        <p>So far so good: we’ve learnt about why regex exists, and using \ to make a character represent more or less possibilities. We’re almost there. The final thing we need to note is that in regex, there is no necessary relationship between the number of characters a regex represents, and the number of characters of the regex itself. For instance, a regular expression can include what are called 'zero-length assertions', like ^ or $. The caret (^) represents the beginning of a line, and the dollar-sign ($) the end of a line. Neither the beginning nor the end of the line are parts of the string <em>per se</em> because the string is simply a collection of characters. Zero-length assertions take up space in your regular expressions, but do not represent space but, rather, position.</p>
        <p>Zero-length assertions demonstrate that regular expressions can match less text than they take up. On the other hand, there are assertions that match more characters than their weight in regex. For instance, [0-9] represents any one character between 0 and 9 – ten characters. The text</p>
        	<pre>numbers0123456789</pre>
        <p>could be matched by [0-9] in exactly ten places, corresponding to the digits in-range. (A regular expression containing 0-9, on the other hand, represents the text 0-9 literally, and one containing \[0-9\] represents the text [0-9] literally.)</p>
        <p>To take another example, .{2,4} represents any substring which is at best 4 characters long and at least 2. Note the full stop – it represents ‘any character’. If we use a regex containing .{2, 4} to iteratively scan the string ‘123456789’, it will match 1-4 and 5-8, but not 9. Regex is ‘greedy’: it always takes as much as it can while preserving the integrity of its matches.</p>
        </p>Putting this all together, we can do some powerful matching, like matching all but the first word on a line, without knowing the line. We can match 'evening' in</p>
        <pre>"morning evening"</pre>
        <p>with</p>
        <pre> .+$</pre> 
        <p> where + represents 'one or more of the preceding character' and . represents 'any character'. You can't see it, but there is a space before the . too. So our regex means 'The largest possible substring composed of one space, and then one or more of any character, until the end of the line'.</p>
        <p>There’s a lot more you can do with regex. You can give it a ‘global’ flag, so that it makes as many matches as it can, rather than just one match; you can feed it alternators, so that it alternates its search between two different expressions as it goes through the string from start to finish; you can use lookaheads and lookbehinds, to capture substrings which are near to other substrings without capturing the nearby substrings themselves. Regex is extremely flexible, and that is what makes it so much more powerful than one-to-one representation.</p>
        <p>Some people love to hate regex, but actually, given the choice, I don't think I would trade it in for anything different. It’s generality - so often complained about - is the very source of its power.</p>
