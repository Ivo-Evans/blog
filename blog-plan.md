# blog plan
 * Much of the styling from my FAC website
 * Only one navbar, no contact bar. Set to display: none on mobile, but pressing hamburger toggles it
 * Navbar is populated with JavaScript: querySelectorAll('.blog-post')
 * blog posts are expandable and collapsible - there is a way of doing this. Look into [CSS line-clamp](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/line-clamp/) with CSS transition to animate or [Clamp.js](https://github.com/josephschmitt/Clamp.js). Ideally i'd like the lines to come in one by one, fast - a cool effect. 
 * some kind of system for formatting code-examples. You could write this yourself, it might be fun... but you know, someone else has already probably written a module for this...
