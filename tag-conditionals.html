        <p>Logic in programming does not map directly onto logic itself. This is fair enough. Logicians aren’t even sure, themselves, what logic is, while computers have to actually work. This means that logic in programming is something that one must learn about. When I first started programming, I lacked a clear and explicit guide and I found myself confused.</p>
        <p>One thing that surprised me was that the logical connectors || and && could both return values other than true and false. Another thing that surprised me was the way that logic used what’s called short-circuit evaluation. A third thing that surprised me was that you could combine these two facts to make || and && statements into conditional, i.e. if-then, statements. But before we get into any of that, we should give a short description of || and &&.</p>
        <h3>1. || and && 101</h3>
        <p>|| is an ‘or’ operator and && is an ‘and’ operator. They each have an arity of two – they take two operands, one on each side, and return a value which represents the logical relationship between their two operands.</p>
        <p>We typically represent these logical relationships with truth tables. Logic is taken to be bivalent: it only has two values, true or false – there is no third value, like ‘half true’ or ‘true in the right context’:</p>
        <div class="parallel-code">

  <tr>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>||</th>
    <th>true</th>
    <th>is...</th>

        <p>Let’s imagine that we have three variables, isInLondon, isLearningToProgram and isAMasterPrgrommaer.</p>
        <code><pre>
let isInLondon = true;
let isLearningToProgram = true;
let isAMasterProgrammer = false;
</pre></code>
        <p>We can feed these variables to || and && for idiomatic assessments of logical relationships:</p>
        <code><pre>
isInLondon && isLearningToProgram // true
isLearningToProgram || isAMasterProgrammer // true
isLearningToProgram && isAMasterProgrammer // false
</pre></code>
        <p>Note that || is ‘nonexclusive’:</p>
        <code><pre>
isInLondon || isLearningToProgram // true
</pre></code>
        <p>For this reason, || and && are inverse operators – each of them returns one value in three cases, and the other in one case. We could also implement an exclusive or (XOR), if we wanted to, in which the above logical statement would come out false. However, the XOR is less important in programming and in logic in general. We'll skip over it for now.</p>
        <h3>2. true v.s. truthy, false v.s. falsy</h3>
        <p>When we’re programming, we give more values than true and false to the logical operators. How does this work?</p>
        <p>It’s not quite like when you use logic in conversation. In conversation, like when you say ‘he is at home and eating dinner’, you feed the logical assertion two statements, sub in each statement for its truth-value at time of evaluation, and you see whether the whole expression is true. If it is, then the logical statement – an assertion of a logical relationship – is true and so should return a truth value.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript it's a bit different. Look at this code:</p>
        <code><pre>
"He's a master programmer" || "He's a whale" // "He's a master programmer"
"He's a whale" || "He's a master programmer" // "He's a whale"
"" || "He's a whale" // "He's a whale"
"He's a whale" || "" // "He's a whale"
</pre></code>
        <p>Alas the computer, on balance, seems sure that I am a whale. But how does it <em>get</em> to that conclusion? It is not, I am afraid to say, to do with the important question of whether I am a master programmer or a whale.</p>
        <p>This is because the computational notion of truth is somewhat divorced from the everyday one. For a computer, the question 'is it true?' is more like 'yes or no?' than 'is it an accurate representation of reality?' Computers were designed from the hardware up, and, at a basic level, they are collections of transistors which are either firing or not firing. Boolean logic, which was already a developed academic field, let the creators of modern computing use these two states - electricity or a lack of electricity - to represent information. True is represented, on a fundamental level, by a firing transistor, and false by a non-firing transistor. 1 and 0 can be used to the same effect as true and false - the symbol used does not matter, as long as the symbols are <em>binary</em> - that is, they let us represent two states.</p>
        <p>JavaScript has moved on from using single transistors to represent truth values. In JavaScript, there are various kinds of value, and they can <em>all</em> be used in logical operations, even though they are not true or false <em>per se</em>. But what we can learn from the foundations of computing is that computational notions of true and false are not really about truth or falsity - the degree to which a representation is accurate - at all. The creators of programming languages have to make more or less arbitrary decisions about what values should behave like they're true, and what values should behave like they're false. The values which behave like they're true, whether or not they are the value true themselves, are called <em>truthy</em> values. The values that behave like they're false, whether or not they are the value false themselves, are called <em>falsy</em> values.</p>
  
<p>A truthy or falsy value can, at any time, do the job of true and false when used in logic, either as the input to or output from a logical operation, because they are temporarily coerced by the operator into Booleans.</p>
        <p>So how can we tell what values are truthy, and what falsy? It's pretty easy. Almost every value is truthy, and there are only seven falsy values:</p>
        <ul>
 <li>false</li>
 <li>0 and 0n</li>
 <li>empty strings</li>
 <li>undefined, null and NaN</li>
</ul>
        <p>(Note, though, that there is some <a href="https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs#-is-truthy-but-not-true">funny business</a> about empty arrays and null.)</p>
        
<p>Now we can see how the computer realised that I'm a whale dressed as a human, and that I'm not a master programmer: In the first line of code above, || receives two truthy strings, and outputs a truthy string; in the third line of code above, || receives a truthy and falsy string, and outputs a truthy string. It's okay to output strings, rather than true or false, because the output of the operation is just as truthy/falsy as the input. Consulting our truth tables from earlier, then, we can see that the operations have logically valid output.</p>
        <h3>3. Short-circuit evaluation</h3>
        <p>So, || and && don’t return truth values, but rather their left-hand-side (LHS) or right-hand-side (RHS) - two terms that will be cropping up a lot from here on. How do || and && decide which side to return, when they could return either of two?</p> 
        <p>Programming languages, by convention, check first the LHS and then the RHS. Sometimes, after the first result, the conclusion is determined. For instance, in the statement:</p>
        <code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
        <p>if LHS is falsy, then, no matter what RHS is, the and-statement, as a whole, must be false. The computer can save time by just ceasing it’s evaluation after it finds LHS to be false. If it finds LHS to be true, it needs to proceed to RHS; if RHS is true, the and-statement is true, and if it is false then, even though LHS is true, the and-statement is false. Either way, though, if LHS is true the truth of the and-statement rests entirely on RHS.</p>
        <p>The converse holds for || statements:</p>
        <code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
        <p>If LHS is true, then, by fiat, the or-statement is true. However, if LHS is false, we still need to check RHS. If it is true, the statement passes, but if it is false, the statement fails.</p>
        <p>Since || and && statements do not return truth values, but either the LHS or RHS, in</p>
        <code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
        <p>if LHS is false, we can return that; else, if LHS is true, we will return RHS. We don't even need to check whether RHS is truty or falsy; whatever it is, it will be logically valid. In</p>
        <code><pre>
LHS || RHS
</pre></code>
        <p>if LHS is true, we can return that; else, if LHS is false, we will return RHS.</p>
        <p>This is short-circuit evaluation. It is a simple, elegant and – dare I say it –  a logical solution. There is no need to compute  a third value (true or false) which represents the operator’s decision. It is guaranteed that we can repurpose one of the inputs, and that we will repurpose the leftmost appropriate input.</p>
        <p>Now, before we close off this section, we should think a little about the consequences of returning truthy and falsy values instead of true and false. Because we can rely on the explicit rules of short-circuit evaluation, we can use logic to do things like decide on our variable assignments for us:</p>
        <code><pre>
let a = 1
let b = “”
let c = a && b
c // “”
</pre></code>
        <h3>4. || and && and conditional logic</h3>
        <p>So far, we’ve covered the meaning of short-circuit evaluation and truthiness and falsiness for || and &&. But these are not the only logical operations we do when programming. One other thing we do is express conditional logic, logic which expresses if-then relationships. Such conditional logic, sometimes called flow-control, lets us establish branching possibilities within our programs.</p>
        <p>The most common kind of conditional statements are if statements, if-else statements, and if-else if -else statements (two if-else statements stuck together). First let’s look at an if statement:</p>
        <code><pre>
let a = 5;
if (a) {
  console.log(‘a is true’);
}
</pre></code>
        <p>Notice that in this statement, we do not need to say if (a == true). a’s truthiness is enough for the logic to execute.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we do want to use operators on values to generate new boolean values, as in this if-else if-else statement, where the < operator is used:</p>
        <code><pre>
if (a < 10) {
  console.log(‘less than ten’);
} else if (a < 50) {
  console.log(‘less than fifty’);
} else {
  console.log(‘wow a must be really big”);
}
</pre></code>
        <p>The output of this code is ‘less than ten’, even though, of course, a is less than fifty. What we see here is a chain of logic that has the same effect as short-circuit evaluation. The second condition, if (a < 50), is itself dependent on the falsity of the first condition, because it is attached to the first condition’s else statement. The second condition is effectively</p>
        <code><pre>
if (!(a < 10)) && (a < 50)
</pre></code>
        <p>Because of this, after the program satisfies that first condition, (a < 10), it simply stops looking at the other conditions, which are premised on the falsity of earlier conditions. To print both conditions, we could attach them to separate if statements, rather than premising later if statements on the else statements of earlier if statements.</p>
        <p>So we can see that conditional logic effectively short-circuits, and we saw earlier that || and && statements short-circuit too. This similarity cuts deep: it lets us use || and && to make conditional statements, and conditional statements to make || and && statements.</p>
        <p>Here are || and && implemented as functions that use conditional logic:</p>
        <code><pre>
  function or(leftHandSide, rightHandSide) {
    if (leftHandSide) {
      return leftHandSide;
    } else {
      return rightHandSide; 
    }
  }
</pre></code>
        <code><pre>
  function and(leftHandSide, rightHandSide) {
    if (leftHandSide) {
      return rightHandSide;
      } else {
      return leftHandSide;
      }
  }      
</pre></code>      
        <p>There’s a nice kind of symmetry here: the only difference between the two functions is what the truthiness of the LHS indicates. In the or function, it indicates that evaluation can stop. In the and function it indicates that evaluation must continue.</p>
        <p>We can implement a converse kind of functionality with || and && operators.</p>
        <code><pre>
  function ifThen(antecedent, consequent) {
    return antecedent && consequent;
  }
</pre></code>
        <code><pre>
  function ifNotThen(antecedent, consequent) {
    return antecedent || consequent;
  }  
</pre></code>      
        <p>I’ve introduced two new terms here, ‘antecedent’ and ‘consequent’. These just mean ‘the bit that comes before’ and ‘the bit that comes after’ in a conditional statement. In the statement ‘if I go to Alaska, I will fulfill a lifelong ambition’, ‘I go to Alaska’ is the antecedent, and ‘I will fulfill a lifelong ambition’ is the consequent.</p>
        <p>The two functions above are not that practical. But using the logical operators && and || to express conditions can be practical. Let’s take a realistic example, trying to parse a string and return an array that contains any numbers inside the string. Given the string:</p>
        <code><pre>
	‘1 2 ,4 &:\ 301’
</pre></code>
        <p>we should return</p>
  
<code><pre>
	[‘1’, ‘2’, ‘4’, ‘301’]
</pre></code>
        <p>To achieve this, we will use the match() function and feed match() a regex.  Our regex will look like this:</p>
        <code><pre>
	/[0-9]+/g
</pre></code>
        <p>[0-9] represents any character 0..9. The plus symbol means ‘one or more of what I preceded’ - [0-9]. The g is a flag which means global, and tells match() to return more than one match.</p>
        <p>We’re all set up, and writing this function should be simple enough.</p>
        <p>However, there is a hitch. A requirement of our function is that it returns an array, even if the array is empty. But match() has an idiosyncrasy: if it finds no matches, it doesn’t return an empty array or an empty string, but returns null.</p>
        <p>How are we to solve the problem? Recall that null is falsy. We can use this to our advantage with some conditional logic.</p>
        <code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  let result = string.match(/[0-9]+/g);
  if (result) {
   return result;
  } else {
    return [];
}
</pre></code>
        <p>This is all right, but it’s quite long. We can shorten the same logic with the ternary operator, a quick way to write if-else statements:</p>
        <code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  let result = string.match(/[0-9]+/g);
  return result ? result : [];
  // if result is truthy, return result, else, return []
}
</pre></code>
        <p>This is good. However, we can do even better with the || operator:</p>
        <code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  return string.match(/[0-9]+/g) || [];
}
</pre></code>
        <p>And this is where using || for conditional logic really shines.</p>
        <p>Of course, you should not always use || and &&. If you want to use multiple consequents, you should opt for the full-fledged if(){} else{} structure. And even for more compact if-else conditions, rather than if-then or if-not-then, the ternary operator is generally preferable.</p>
        <p>However, if what you want to say is ‘if a then b, else a’, or ‘if not a then b, else a’ - in other words, if you want to choose between two operands - consider using a && b or a || b. And remember, logic in programming doesn't really bear much of a relation to logic, or to truth and falsity - it's just an arbitrary set of rules for the transformation of data. </p>
