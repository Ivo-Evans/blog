        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Hi, I am Ivo Evans, a programmer based in London.</p>

        <h3>Why I'm writing this blog</h3>

        <p>I'm writing this blog because I want to give beginners information that I couldn't find easily, or that I struggled with, when I started learning to program. I don't do this because I am an expert - I'm definitely not (in fact I'm about to begin a bootcamp) - but because I am an active learner. There's some evidence that <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/9853/chapter/5#44">active learners are effective teachers alongside experts</a>, complimenting the comprehensive knowledge of experts with knowledge of what it is that novices don't take for granted. Similarly, and perhaps more importantly, there is evidence that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/">trying to teach something is an excellent way to learn it</a>. I aim to make the topics in the blog fundamental to programming practice - things which, to a software developer, might seem so obvious as to be almost pointless things to say, but which are not necessarily obvious to someone coming to the topic for the first time. It's also a good excuse to get some practice making websites.</p> 

        <h3>This blog as a technical project</h3>
        <p>This blog and its content-management system were made, from the ground up and with love, by me. I probably could have just used Jekyll or Middleman, but I wanted to get practice with software design and keep my Ruby skills sharp. Maybe now I've made my own content-managment system, I'll have more to learn from these sophisticated commercial ones. Mine can be found in the source code repo, linked below. I'm pretty pleased with it. Feel free to adapt it for your own non-profit ventures.</p>
