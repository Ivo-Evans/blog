        <p>Logic in programming does not map directly onto logic itself. This is fair enough. Logicians aren’t even sure, themselves, what logic is, but computers have to actually work. This means that logic in programming is something that one must learn about. When I first started programming, I lacked a clear and explicit guide and I found myself confused.</p>
        <p>One thing that surprised me was that the logical connectors || and && could both return values other than true and false. Another thing that surprised me was the way that logic used what’s called short-circuit evaluation. A third thing that surprised me was that you could combine these two facts to make || and && statements into conditional, i.e. if-then, statements. But before we get into any of that, we should give a short description of || and &&.</p>
        <h3>1. || and && 101</h3>
        <p>|| is an ‘or’ operator and && is an ‘and’ operator. They each have an arity of two – they take two operands, one on each side, and return a value which represents the logical relationship between their two operands.</p>
        <p>We typically represent these logical relationships with truth tables. Logic is taken to be bivalent: it only has two values, true or false – there is no third value, like ‘half true’ or ‘true in the right context’:</p>
        <div class="parallel-code">

    <th>true</th>
    <th>||</th>
    <th>true</th>

        </table>
</div>
        <p>Let’s imagine that we have three variables, isInLondon, isLearningToProgram and isAMasterPrgrommaer.</p>
        <code><pre>
let isInLondon = true;
let isLearningToProgram = true;
let isAMasterProgrammer = false;
</pre></code>
        <p>We can feed these variables to || and && for idiomatic assessments of logical relationships:</p>
        <code><pre>
isInLondon && isLearningToProgram // true
isLearningToProgram || isAMasterProgrammer // true
isLearningToProgram && isAMasterProgrammer // false
</pre></code>
        <p>Note that || is ‘nonexclusive’:</p>
        <code><pre>
isInLondon || isLearningToProgram // true
</pre></code>
        <p>For this reason, || and && are inverse operators – each of them returns one value in three cases, and the other in one case. We could also implement an exclusive or (XOR), if we wanted to, in which the above logical statement would come out false. However, the XOR is less important in programming and in logic in general. We'll skip over it for now.</p>
        <h3>2. true v.s. truthy, false v.s. falsy</h3>
        <p>When we’re programming, we give more values than true and false to the logical operators. How does this work?</p>
        <p>It’s not quite like when you use logic in conversation. In conversation, like when you say ‘he is at home and eating dinner’, you feed the logical assertion two statements, sub in each statement for its truth-value at time of evaluation, and you see whether the whole expression is true. If it is, then the logical statement – an assertion of a logical relationship – is true and so should return a truth value.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript it's a bit different. Look at this code:</p>
        <code><pre>
"He's a master programmer" || "He's a whale" // "He's a master programmer"
"He's a whale" || "He's a master programmer" // "He's a whale"
"" || "He's a whale" // "He's a whale"
"He's a whale" || "" // "He's a whale"
</pre></code>
        <p>Alas the computer, on balance, seems sure that I am a whale. But how does it <em>get</em> to that conclusion? It is not, I am afraid to say, to do with the important question of whether I am a master programmer or a whale.</p>
        <p>This is because the computational notion of truth is somewhat divorced from the everyday one. For a computer, the question 'is it true?' is more like 'does it exist?' than 'is it an accurate representation of reality?' Computers were designed from the hardware up, and, at a basic level, they are collections of transistors which are either firing or not firing. Boolean logic let the creators of modern computing use these two states - electricity or a lack of electricity - to represent information, so true is represented, on a fundamental level, by a firing transistor and false by a non-firing transistor (1 and 0 can be used to the same effect as true and false).</p>
        <p>JavaScript has moved on from using single transistors to represent truth values. In JavaScript, there are various kinds of value, and they can <em>all</em> be used in logical operations, even though they are not true or false <em>per se</em>. Every value is either <em>truthy</em> or <em>falsy</em>. This means that they can, at any time, do the job of true and false when used in logic, either as the input to or output from a logical operation, even when they are not the value true or the value false (this is part of JavaScript's system of type conversion, but one of the better parts). In the first line of code above, || receives two truthy strings, and outputs a truthy string; in the third line of code above, || receives a truthy and falsy string, and outputs a truthy string. Consulting our truth tables from earlier, we can see that this is valid.</p>
        <p>So how can we tell what values are truthy, and what falsy? It's pretty easy. Almost every value is truthy. There are only seven falsy values:</p>
        <ul>
 <li>false</li>
 <li>0 and 0n</li>
 <li>empty strings</li>
 <li>undefined, null and NaN</li>
</ul>
        <p>(Note, though, that there is some <a href="https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs#-is-truthy-but-not-true">funny business</a> about empty arrays and null.)</p>
        <h3>3. Short-circuit evaluation</h3>
        <p>So, || and && don’t return truth values, but rather their <em>left-hand-side</em> (LHS) or <em>right-hand-side</em> (RHS) - two terms that will be cropping up a lot from here on. How do || and && decide which side to return? Assessing the truth of a logical statement amounts to nothing more than checking the truth-value of the LHS and RHS. Programming languages, by convention, check first the left-hand-side and then the right-hand-side. Sometimes, after the first result, the conclusion is determined. For instance, in the statement:</p>
        <code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
        if LHS is falsy, then, no matter what RHS is, the and-statement, as a whole, must be false. The computer can save time by just ceasing it’s evaluation after it finds LHS to be false. Conversely, though, if it finds LHS to be true, it does need to proceed to RHS; if RHS is true, the and-statement is true, but if it is false then, even though LHS is true, the and-statement is false. Either way, though, at this point the truth of the and-statement rests entirely on the value of RHS.
        <p>The converse holds for || statements:</p>
        <code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
        <p>If LHS is true, then, by fiat, the or-statement is true. However, if LHS is false, we still need to check RHS. If it is true, the statement passes, but if it is false, the statement fails.</p>
        <p>This system of evaluation is known as short-circuit evaluation. Recall that in the last section, we said that || and && statements do not return truth values, but either the LHS or RHS. In</p>
        <code><pre>
LHS && RHS
</pre></code>
        <p>if LHS is false, we can return that; else, if LHS is true, we will return RHS. In</p>
        <code><pre>
LHS || RHS
</pre></code>
        <p>if LHS is true, we can return that; else, if LHS is false, we will return RHS. This is short-circuit evaluation. It is a simple, elegant and – dare I say it –  a logical solution. There is no need to compute  a third value (true or false) which represents the operator’s decision. It is guaranteed that we can repurpose one of the inputs, and that we will repurpose the leftmost appropriate input.</p>
        <p>Now, before we close off this section, we should think a little about the consequences of returning truthy and falsy values instead of true and false. Because we can rely on the explicit rules of short-circuit evaluation, we can use logic to do things like decide on our variable assignments for us:</p>
        <code><pre>
let a = 1
let b = “”
let c = a && b
c // “”
</pre></code>
        <h3>4. || and && and conditional logic</h3>
        <p>So far, we’ve covered the meaning of short-circuit evaluation and truthiness and falsiness for || and &&. But these are not the only logical operations we do when programming. One other thing we do is express conditional logic, logic which expresses if-then relationships. Such conditional logic, sometimes called flow-control, lets us establish branching possibilities within our programs.</p>
        <p>The most common kind of conditional statements are if statements, if-else statements, and if-else if -else statements (two if-else statements stuck together). First let’s look at an if statement:</p>
        <code><pre>
let a = 5;
if (a) {
  console.log(‘a is true’);
}
</pre></code>
        <p>Notice that in this statement, we do not need to say if (a == true). a’s truthiness is enough for the logic to execute.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we do want to use operators on values to generate new boolean values, as in this if-else if-else statement, where the < operator is used:</p>
        <code><pre>
if (a < 10) {
  console.log(‘less than ten’);
} else if (a < 50) {
  console.log(‘less than fifty’);
} else {
  console.log(‘wow a must be really big”);
}
</pre></code>
        <p>The output of this code is ‘less than ten’, even though, of course, a is less than fifty. What we see here is a chain of logic that has the same effect as short-circuit evaluation. The second condition, if (a < 50), is itself dependent on the falsity of the first condition, because it is attached to the first condition’s else statement. The second condition is effectively</p>
        <code><pre>
if (!(a < 10)) && (a < 50)
</pre></code>
        <p>Because of this, after the program satisfies that first condition, (a < 10), it simply stops looking at the other conditions, which are premised on the falsity of earlier conditions. To print both conditions, we could attach them to separate if statements, rather than premising later if statements on the else statements of earlier if statements.</p>
        <p>So we can see that conditional logic effectively short-circuits, and we saw earlier that || and && statements short-circuit too. This similarity cuts deep: it lets us use || and && to make conditional statements, and conditional statements to make || and && statements.</p>
        <p>Here are || and && implemented as functions that use conditional logic:</p>
        <code><pre>
  function or(leftHandSide, rightHandSide) {
    if (leftHandSide) {
      return leftHandSide;
    } else {
      return rightHandSide; 
    }
  }
</pre></code>
        <code><pre>
  function and(leftHandSide, rightHandSide) {
    if (leftHandSide) {
      return rightHandSide;
      } else {
      return leftHandSide;
      }
  }      
</pre></code>      
        <p>There’s a nice kind of symmetry here: the only difference between the two functions is what the truthiness of the LHS indicates. In the or function, it indicates that evaluation can stop. In the and function it indicates that evaluation must continue.</p>
        <p>We can implement a converse kind of functionality with || and && operators.</p>
        <code><pre>
  function ifThen(antecedent, consequent) {
    return antecedent && consequent;
  }
</pre></code>
        <code><pre>
  function ifNotThen(antecedent, consequent) {
    return antecedent || consequent;
  }  
</pre></code>      
        <p>I’ve introduced two new terms here, ‘antecedent’ and ‘consequent’. These just mean ‘the bit that comes before’ and ‘the bit that comes after’ in a conditional statement. In the statement ‘if I go to Alaska, I will fulfill a lifelong ambition’, ‘I go to Alaska’ is the antecedent, and ‘I will fulfill a lifelong ambition’ is the consequent.</p>
        <p>The two functions above are not that practical. But using the logical operators && and || to express conditions can be practical. Let’s take a realistic example, trying to parse a string and return an array that contains any numbers inside the string. Given the string:</p>
        <code><pre>
	‘1 2 ,4 &:\ 301’
</pre></code>
        <p>we should return</p>
  
<code><pre>
	[‘1’, ‘2’, ‘4’, ‘301’]
</pre></code>
        <p>To achieve this, we will use the match() function and feed match() a regex.  Our regex will look like this:</p>
        <code><pre>
	/[0-9]+/g
</pre></code>
        <p>[0-9] represents any character 0..9. The plus symbol means ‘one or more of what I preceded’ - [0-9]. The g is a flag which means global, and tells match() to return more than one match.</p>
        <p>We’re all set up, and writing this function should be simple enough.</p>
        <p>However, there is a hitch. A requirement of our function is that it returns an array, even if the array is empty. But match() has an idiosyncrasy: if it finds no matches, it doesn’t return an empty array or an empty string, but returns null.</p>
        <p>How are we to solve the problem? Recall that null is falsy. We can use this to our advantage with some conditional logic.</p>
        <code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  let result = string.match(/[0-9]+/g);
  if (result) {
   return result;
  } else {
    return [];
}
</pre></code>
        <p>This is all right, but it’s quite long. We can shorten the same logic with the ternary operator, a quick way to write if-else statements:</p>
        <code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  let result = string.match(/[0-9]+/g);
  return result ? result : [];
  // if result is truthy, return result, else, return []
}
</pre></code>
        <p>This is good. However, we can do even better with the || operator:</p>
        <code><pre>
  function findNumbers(string) {
  return string.match(/[0-9]+/g) || [];
}
</pre></code>
        <p>And this is where using || for conditional logic really shines.</p>
        <p>Of course, you should not always use || and &&. If you want to use multiple consequents, you should opt for the full-fledged if(){} else{} structure. And even for more compact if-else conditions, rather than if-then or if-not-then, the ternary operator is generally preferable.</p>
        <p>However, if what you want to say is ‘if a then b, else a’, or ‘if not a then b, else a’ - in other words, if you want to choose between two operands - consider using a && b or a || b. And remember, logic in programming doesn't really bear much of a relation to logic, or to truth and falsity - it's just an arbitrary set of rules for the transformation of data. </p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>It doesn't need to be an awkward discussion. All we need is some simple <strong>vocabulary</strong></p>
        <h3>1. Arity</h3>
        <p>An operator’s arity is the number of arguments – also called operands – that it takes. For instance, comparison operators have an arity of two – they take two operands:</p>
        <pre><code>
	// true
	5 < 10
</code></pre>
        <p>Here, 5 is one operand and 10 is another.</p>
        <p>An arity of two is the most common arity in JavaScript. Some operators have an arity of 1:</p>
        <pre><code>
	!false
	// true
	typeof true
	// boolean
</code></pre>
        <p>One operator has an arity of three, the ternary operator. Ternary means 'composed of three parts' and the ternary operator is used to express conditional logic:</p>
        <pre><code>
	condition ? true : false
</code></pre>
        <p>The first operand, the bit to the left of the ?, is a condition to be evaluated. If it is evaluated to true, then the second operand, the bit in between ? and :, is executed. If the first operand is evaluated to false,  the third operand, the bit after :, is executed.</p>
        <pre><code>
	let iAmIvo = true;
	function amIIvo(bool) {
	  return bool ? ‘yup’ : ‘no’;
	}
	amIIvo(iAmIvo); // ‘yup’
</code></pre>
        <h3>2. Associativity</h3>
        <p>Next up is an operator’s associativity. This isn’t about how operators interact with each other (that’s precedence) but about how operands interact with each other and with the operator. Basically it is the direction in which operands are evaluated. It can be either right-to-left or left-to-right. When an operator is left-to-right associative, we sometimes say that it is left-associative, and when it is right-to-left associative, we sometimes say that it is right associative.</p>
        <p>Mathematical and logical operators are left-to-right associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	10 – 5 // 5
	true || false // true
</code></pre>
        <p>The ternary operator is left-associative too:</p>
        <pre><code>
	condition ? ‘true’ : ‘false’
</code></pre>
        <p>Assignment, on the other hand, is right-to-left associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;
	let c = a;
	c; // 1 
</code></pre>
        <p>Unary operators - operators with an arity of 1 - tend to be right-associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	!false
	// true	
	typeof Object
	// “function”
</code></pre>
        <h3>3. Precedence</h3>
        <p>A function’s precedence expresses where it stands in relation to other operators. If it has a high precedence, it is evaluated early. This means that it has first dibs on its operands. If it has low precedence, it is evaluated later. It receives only the operands that other operators didn’t want, or have already processed.</p>
        <p>Look at this mathematical expression:</p>
        <pre><code>
	1 * (0 – 1) === 1 * 0 – 1
	// true
</code></pre>
        <p>Since it returns true, we can tell that the logical comparison operator === has lower precedence than the numerical operators. If it had high precedence – first dibs – it would compare (0 – 1) with (1), and find them nonequal. However, in actuality it compares -1 with -1 and finds them equal.</p>
        <h3>4. Putting it all together</h3>
        <p>Putting it all together, we can now explain exactly why compound expressions work like they do. Let's take an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
	2 * (4 – 1) !== 2 * 4 – 1 ? "they’re not equal" : "they’re equal"
</code></pre>
        <p>The operator with the highest precedence here is the grouping operator (), followed by *, so we should start with the sums,</p>
        <pre><code>
	2 * (4 – 1)
	2 * 4 – 1
</code></pre>
        <p>which resolve to 6 and 7 respectively. The brackets introduce a difference, not because the multiplication operator is further to the left than the subtraction operator, but because multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction (following <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html">PEMDAS/BIDMAS</a>).</p>
        <p>the operator with the next highest precedence is the inequality operator. It has an arity of two, and for this example it doesn't really matter whether it is right-associative or left-associative (in general, it is left-associative, so console.log('hello') !=== console.log('world') prints hello and then world and then returns false). In this example !== receives two numbers - 6 and 7 - and finds them to be unequal. Therefore it returns true.</p>
        <p>Finally we have the ternary operator, the lowest-precedence operator in the equation above. It is left-associative, so it looks first to its left-hand-side, and uses that information to decide between its remaining operands. Since its left-hand-side is the value true, it chooses its second operand, "they are not equal".</p>
        <p>These three properties, arity, associativity and precedence, neatly divide the conceptual space for operators. With them, you can say all that you need to say, and learn precisely about the relationships between operators. As a next step, you might want to consult a comparative table like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table">this one</a>.</p>

        <p>Regular expressions, as a system for representing text, are found in most programming languages. In this post, I’m going to focus on JavaScript, which happens to be my favourite programming language (although, it must be said, not for its implementation of regex).</p>
        <h3>1: regular expressions are values</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript regular expressions are a data-type called RegExp. Like most data-types, they can be constructed using literals or an object constructor:</p>
        <pre><code>
‘5’ // a string literal
String(5) // a string created by the constructor function for the string type

        <p>The syntax for a RegExp literal is to enclose the expression within two forward slashes:</p>
        <code>/(ab){3}/   // a regex matching 3 consecutive ab’s: ababab</code>
        <p>This forward-slash syntax was popularised by Perl, a language which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#History">did a lot for regular expressions<a>. It is also the most common way to make regular expressions in JavaScript. Since RegExps are not strings, there is no need for any string syntax when creating a RegExp literal. This is different when using the RegExp constructor. Here, we drop the forward slashes, and feed the constructor a string as its argument, leaving it up to the function to make the regular expression for us:</p>
        <code>RegExp(‘(ab){3}’)</code>
        <p>Because regular expressions are objects, they can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Given to functions as arguments</li>
            <code>"123”.match(/2/) // ["2", index: 1, input: "123", groups: undefined]</code>
          <li>Returned from functions</li>
            <code>RegExp(‘a’) // returns a regular expression</code>
          <li>functions can be called on them</li>
            <code>/a/.test(‘a hungry hippo’) // true</code>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s look in more detail at two functions that work with regular expressions, match() and replace(). Both of these functions are called on strings and take regular expressions as arguments.</p>
        <h3>2: match()</h3>
        <p>match() returns matches it finds. By default, match() returns an object corresponding to the first match it found.</p>
        <pre><code>
let str = “stringy string”
str.match(/[ng]/) // ["n", index: 4, input: "stringy string", groups: undefined]
// square brackets [] mean ‘any of these characters’.
str // “stringy string”
</code></pre>
        <p>However, match really comes into its own when you give the regex the global flag. Then, match returns an array of substrings that match the regex. You give flags to regex literals by adding a letter after the second forward slash, and to regex constructor functions by providing a second argument:</p>
        <pre><code>
let regExOne = /st/g
let regExTwo = RegExp(‘[ng]’, ‘g’)
str.match(regExOne); // [“st”, “st”]
str.match(regExTwo); // [“n”, “g”, “n”, “g”]
</code></pre>
        <h3>3: replace()</h3>
        <p>Next up is replace(), which replaces a substring with another, or multiple substrings with another if you use the global flag. replace() takes two arguments. First, it searches the string on which it was called according to its first argument, a regex. Secondly, it substitutes a match, if it finds one, using its second argument. It does not ‘mutate’ the string it is called on – strings are immutable in JavaScript – but returns a new string.</p>
        <p>When I add articles to this blog, I write them to text files, and then I run a program that I wrote and it compiles HTML for me, ensuring that articles appear in the right place, get added to the archive page automatically, and things like that. I used Ruby to write this program but it could have been done in JavaScript too. It scans a text file called website-template.html, finds a line which says
        <p><code>&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;</code>,</p>
        <p><em>replaces</em> that line with article content that it got elsewhere, and then writes the new string to a new file - a file just like the one your browser has rendered to let you read this. (Here's the relevant <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/blog/blob/master/resources/modules/writable.rb">Ruby method</a> if you're curious.)</p>
        <p>I could have used string-for-string replacement, like</p>
        <code>webSite = webSite.replace('&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;', mainContent);</code>
        <p>However, I opted for a regular expression:</p>
        <code>webSite = webSite.replace(/^\s*&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;/, mainContent);</code>
        </p>This regular expression matches 0 or more whitespace characters from the beginning of the line to the end of &lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt.</p> 
        <p>I used regex for three reasons:</p>
        <ol>
  <li>If I used regex, I could allow for a varying amount of whitespace.</li>
  <li>The input was expectable and controllable, so this was a very safe regular expression.</li>
  <li>The Ruby method I used was going to read my string as a regular expression anyway.</li>
</ol>
        <p>Each of these reasons tells us something wider about why and when to use regular expressions.</p>
        <p> A good reason to use them, as discussed in the last article, is that they allow more general matching than one-to-one correspondence. In this case generality solved a specific problem for me: while I knew what I wanted matching lines to say, I didn't want to commit to indenting them some specific amount, because I might change the html template. I also didn't want to only select the comment itself, and not whitespace preceding it on the line, because then when I wrote the new content the first line would have more indentation than other lines. A regex which allowed me to select from the beginning of the line, to a specific match, including an arbitrary amount of whitespace, proved useful.</p>
        <p>It was also a good case for a regex because it was very easy to control. If you want to use regular expressions to sift large and unpredictable data-sets, you will have to think carefully. For instance, it is generally not recommended to use regular expressions to write parsers for programming languages. For less-lofty aims, regular expressions can be useful, but you do need to be careful with them. If you cast your net too wide, you might catch some junk. Once you get beyond syntax, for regex, the crux of the challenge is often striking the right balance between specificity and generality.</p>
        <p>Finally, a good reason to use regular expressions is their prevalence. Regular expressions are <em>everywhere</em>, and so you can count on them as a useful and transferable skill for efficient and sophisticated - but not too sophisticated - text-matching.</p>
        <h3>4: conclusion</h3>
        <p>This marks the end of my brief series on regex. I hope I've equipped you with an appreciation of the usefulness of regular expressions, as well as a grasp of the fundamentals.</p>
