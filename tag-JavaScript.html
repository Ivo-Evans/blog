        <p>It doesn't need to be an awkward discussion. All we need is some simple <strong>vocabulary</strong></p>
        <h3>1. Arity</h3>
        <p>An operator’s arity is the number of arguments – also called operands – that it takes. For instance, comparison operators have an arity of two – they take two operands:</p>
        <pre><code>
	// true
	5 < 10
</code></pre>
        <p>Here, 5 is one operand and 10 is another.</p>
        <p>An arity of two is the most common arity in JavaScript. Some operators have an arity of 1:</p>
        <pre><code>
	!false
	// true
	typeof true
	// boolean
</code></pre>
        <p>One operator has an arity of three, the ternary operator. Ternary means 'composed of three parts' and the ternary operator is used to express conditional logic:</p>
        <pre><code>
	condition ? true : false
</code></pre>
        <p>The first operand, the bit to the left of the ?, is a condition to be evaluated. If it is evaluated to true, then the second operand, the bit in between ? and :, is executed. If the first operand is evaluated to false,  the third operand, the bit after :, is executed.</p>
        <pre><code>
	let iAmIvo = true;
	function amIIvo(bool) {
	  return bool ? ‘yup’ : ‘no’;
	}
	amIIvo(iAmIvo); // ‘yup’
</code></pre>
        <h3>2. Associativity</h3>
        <p>Next up is an operator’s associativity. This isn’t about how operators interact with each other (that’s precedence) but about how operands interact with each other and with the operator. Basically it is the direction in which operands are evaluated. It can be either right-to-left or left-to-right. When an operator is left-to-right associative, we sometimes say that it is left-associative, and when it is right-to-left associative, we sometimes say that it is right associative.</p>
        <p>Mathematical and logical operators are left-to-right associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	10 – 5 // 5
	true || false // true
</code></pre>
        <p>The ternary operator is left-associative too:</p>
        <pre><code>
	condition ? ‘true’ : ‘false’
</code></pre>
        <p>Assignment, on the other hand, is right-to-left associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;
	let c = a;
	c; // 1 
</code></pre>
        <p>Unary operators - operators with an arity of 1 - tend to be right-associative:</p>
        <pre><code>
	!false
	// true	
	typeof Object
	// “function”
</code></pre>
        <h3>3. Precedence</h3>
        <p>A function’s precedence expresses where it stands in relation to other operators. If it has a high precedence, it is evaluated early. This means that it has first dibs on its operands. If it has low precedence, it is evaluated later. It receives only the operands that other operators didn’t want, or have already processed.</p>
        <p>Look at this mathematical expression:</p>
        <pre><code>
	1 * (0 – 1) === 1 * 0 – 1
	// true
</code></pre>
        <p>Since it returns true, we can tell that the logical comparison operator === has lower precedence than the numerical operators. If it had high precedence – first dibs – it would compare (0 – 1) with (1), and find them nonequal. However, in actuality it compares -1 with -1 and finds them equal.</p>
        <h3>4. Putting it all together</h3>
        <p>Putting it all together, we can now explain exactly why compound expressions work like they do. Let's take an example:</p>
        <pre><code>
	2 * (4 – 1) !== 2 * 4 – 1 ? "they’re not equal" : "they’re equal"
</code></pre>
        <p>The operator with the highest precedence here is the grouping operator (), followed by *, so we should start with the sums,</p>
        <pre><code>
	2 * (4 – 1)
	2 * 4 – 1
</code></pre>
        <p>which resolve to 6 and 7 respectively. The brackets introduce a difference, not because the multiplication operator is further to the left than the subtraction operator, but because multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction (following <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html">PEMDAS/BIDMAS</a>).</p>
        <p>the operator with the next highest precedence is the inequality operator. It has an arity of two, and for this example it doesn't really matter whether it is right-associative or left-associative (in general, it is left-associative, so console.log('hello') !=== console.log('world') prints hello and then world and then returns false). In this example !== receives two numbers - 6 and 7 - and finds them to be unequal. Therefore it returns true.</p>
        <p>Finally we have the ternary operator, the lowest-precedence operator in the equation above. It is left-associative, so it looks first to its left-hand-side, and uses that information to decide between its remaining operands. Since its left-hand-side is the value true, it chooses its second operand, "they are not equal".</p>
        <p>These three properties, arity, associativity and precedence, neatly divide the conceptual space for operators. With them, you can say all that you need to say, and learn precisely about the relationships between operators. As a next step, you might want to consult a comparative table like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table">this one</a>.</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Regular expressions, as a system for representing text, are found in most programming languages. In this post, I’m going to focus on JavaScript, which happens to be my favourite programming language (although not for its implementation of regex, which currently lacks some features, like lookbehinds and interpolation).</p>
        <h3>1: regular expressions are values</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript regular expressions are a data-type called RegExp. Like most data-types, they can be constructed using literals or an object constructor:</p>
        <pre><code>
‘5’ // a string literal
String(5) // a string created by the constructor function for the string type
</code></pre>
        <p>The syntax for a RegExp literal is to enclose the expression within two forward slashes:</p>
        <code>/(ab){3}/   // a regex matching 3 consecutive ab’s: ababab</code>
        <p>This forward-slash syntax was popularised by Perl, a language which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#History">did a lot for regular expressions<a>. It is also the most common syntax in JavaScript. Since RegExps are not strings, there is no need for any string syntax when creating a RegExp literal. This is different when using the RegExp constructor. Here, we drop the forward slashes, and feed the constructor a string as its argument, leaving it up to the function to make the regular expression for us:</p>
        <code>RegExp(‘(ab){3}’)</code>
        <p>Because regular expressions are objects, they can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Given to functions as arguments</li>
            <code>123”.match(/2/) // ["2", index: 1, input: "123", groups: undefined]</code>
          <li>Returned from functions</li>
            <code>RegExp(‘a’) // returns a regular expression</code>
          <li>functions can be called on them</li>
            <code>/a/.test(‘a hungry hippo’) // true</code>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s look in more detail at two functions that work with regular expressions, match() and replace(). Both of these functions are called on strings and take regular expressions as arguments.</p>
        <h3>2: match()</h3>
        <p>match() returns matches it finds. By default, match() returns an object corresponding to the first match it found.</p>
        <pre><code>
let str = “stringy string”
str.match(/[ng]/) // ["n", index: 4, input: "stringy string", groups: undefined]
// square brackets [] mean ‘any of these characters’.
str // “stringy string”
</code></pre>
        <p>However, match really comes into its own when you give the regex the global flag. Then, match returns an array of substrings that match the regex. You give flags to regex literals by adding a letter after the second forward slash, and to regex constructor functions by providing a second argument:</p>
        <pre><code>
let regExOne = /st/g
let regExTwo = RegExp(‘[ng]’, ‘g’)
str.match(regExOne); // [“st”, “st”]
str.match(regExTwo); // [“n”, “g”, “n”, “g”]
</code></pre>
        <h3>3: replace()</h3>
        <p>Next up is replace(), which replaces a substring with another, or multiple substrings with another if you use the global flag. replace() takes two arguments. First, it searches the string on which it was called according to its first argument, a regex. Secondly, it substitutes a match, if it finds one, using its second argument. It does not ‘mutate’ the string it is called on – strings are immutable in JavaScript – but returns a new string.</p>
        <p>When I add articles to this blog, I write them to text files, and then I run a program that I wrote and it compiles HTML for me, ensuring that articles appear in the right place, get added to the archive page automatically, and things like that. I used Ruby to write this program but it could have been done in JavaScript too. It scans a text file called website-template.html, finds a line which says
        <p><code>&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;</code>,</p>
        <p><em>replaces</em> that line with article content that it got elsewhere, and then writes the new string to a new file - a file just like the one your browser has rendered to let you read this. Here's the relevant <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/blog/blob/master/resources/modules/writable.rb">Ruby method</a>, if you're curious.</p>
        <p>I could have used string-for-string replacement, like</p>
        <code>webSite = webSite.replace('&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;', mainContent);</code>
        <p>However, I opted for a regular expression:</p>
        <code>webSite = webSite.replace(/^\s*&lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt;/, mainContent);</code>
        </p>This regular expression matches 0 or more whitespace characters from the beginning of the line to the end of &lt;!-- INSERT ARTICLES HERE --&gt.</p> 
        <p>I used regex for three reasons:</p>
        <ol>
  <li>If I used regex, I could allow for a varying amount of whitespace.</li>
  <li>The input was expectable and controllable, so this was a very <em>safe</em> regular expression.</li>
  <li>The Ruby method I used was going to read my string as a regular expression <em>anyway</em>.</li>
</ol>
        <p>Each of these reasons tells us something wider about why and when to use regular expressions.</p>
        <p> A good reason to use them, as discussed in the last article, is that they allow more general matching than one-to-one correspondence. In this case this generality solved a specific problem for me: while I knew what I wanted matching lines to say, I didn't want to commit to indenting them some specific amount, because I might change the html template. I also didn't want to only select the comment itself, and not whitespace preceding it on the line, because then when I wrote the new content the first line would have more indentation than other lines. A regex which allowed me to select from the beginning of the line, to a specific match, including an arbitrary amount of whitespace, proved useful.</p>
        <p>It was also a good case for a regex because it was very easy to control. If you want to use regular expressions to sift large and unpredictable data-sets, you will have to think carefully. For instance, it is generally not recommended to use regular expressions to write parsers for programming languages. For less-lofty aims, regular expressions can be useful, but you do need to be careful with them. If you cast your net too wide, you will probably catch a lot of junk. Once you get beyond syntax, for regex, the crux of the challenge is often striking the right balance between specificity and generality.</p>
        <p>Finally, a good reason to use regular expressions is their prevalence. Regular expressions are <em>everywhere</em>, and so you can count on them as a useful and transferable skill for efficient and sophisticated - but not too sophisticated - text-matching.</p>
        <h3>4: conclusion</h3>
        <p>This marks the end of my brief series on regex. I hope I've equipped you with an appreciation of the usefulness of regular expressions, as well as a grasp of the fundamentals.</p>
