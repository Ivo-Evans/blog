      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I came up with this solution when trying to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 10 but having troulbe adjusting boot order. After phoning HP and finding that access to my boot order had been deliberately obfuscated to make sure people boot into the 'right' operating system, Windows 10 - thanks HP - I turned my efforts to accessing the BIOS, from which I could get to Ubuntu's bootloader relatively quickly. I wrote a Powershell function which, when executed, restarts the computer directly into the firmware settings. No more button-bashing, and a lot of time saved.</p>
        <p>To follow along you don't need any real PowerShell knowledge. Our strategy will be to define a function in your user PowerShell profile ($PROFILE), a text file which is read every time you open PowerShell. That way, the function will always be defined, and all you need to do is call it.</p> 
        <h3>1. Prepare your $PROFILE</h3>
        <p>This text file does not exist by default, but you might already have it. To see whether you do, enter</p>
        <code>test-path $PROFILE</code>
        <p>Note that PowerShell, unlike Linux shells, is case-insensitive, so you can just as well write</p>
        <code>test-path $profile</code>
        <p>This cmmdlet works because there is already a path to the profile written into your system - you just might not yet have the profile itself. If it returns false, enter</p>
        <code>New-Item -path $profile -type file</code>
        <p>Now everyone should have a profile file, we can open and edit it with</p>
        <pre><code>
notepad $PROFILE
code $PROFILE # for vscode
atom $PROFILE 
etc.
</code></pre>
        <h3>2. Add a function to your $profile</h3>
        <p>The function we are going to write can be anywhere inside your profile (except within other code). What it does is run two cmmdlets successively. The first one opens a PowerShell instance that has administrator privileges. The second one uses our administrator privileges to reboot you into firmware.</p>
        <p>The first looks like this:</p>
        <code>Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs</code>
        <p>To run it, you might have to press yes on a dialogue box that opens up. The quickest way to do that is to press left arrow then enter.</p>
        <p>The second cmmdlet looks like this:</p>
        <code>shutdown /fw /r /t 0</code>
        <p>/fw means 'firmware', /r 'restart', and /t 0 'after 0 seconds'.</p>
        <p>Our final function looks like this</p>
        <pre><code>
	function boot-fw {
	  Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs -ArgumentList 'shutdown /fw /r /t 0'
	}
</code></pre>
        <p>We feed the second cmmdlet to the first one as a string following -ArgumentList. We then wrap that whole thing in a function, called boot-fw. Best practice is to use verb-noun format to avoid namespace conflicts - but on my own system I broke the rules and went for an even shorter name, fboot. Just put this function anywhere in your $profile and, after opening a new powershell instance, it should be available.</p>
        <p>Now you can type boot-fw to boot into your firmware settings. Or to boot for the win, whatever you like.</p> 
        <p>PROTIP: adding the line Clear-Host to your $PROFILE means that when you open a new PowerShell window you won't see any of Windows' proprietary junk. You might want to check out other things that you can add to the profile, like some (limited) theming.</p>
